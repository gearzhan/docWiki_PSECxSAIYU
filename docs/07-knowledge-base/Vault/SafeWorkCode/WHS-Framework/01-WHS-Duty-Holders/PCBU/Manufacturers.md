# Manufacturers and Importers - WHS Duties

## Who is a Manufacturer?

A manufacturer is a person who conducts a business or undertaking that includes manufacturing:
- **Plant** (machinery, equipment, appliances, implements, tools, vehicles)
- **Substances** (chemicals, materials used at work)
- **Structures** (buildings, prefabricated structures, structural components)

## Who is an Importer?

An importer is a person who conducts a business or undertaking that includes importing plant, substances, or structures for use at work.

## Primary Duty

Manufacturers and importers must ensure, **so far as is reasonably practicable**, that the plant, substance, or structure is **without risks to health and safety** when:
- Used for its intended purpose
- Handled, stored, or transported as intended
- Installed or constructed (for plant and structures)
- Properly maintained (for plant)
- Disposed of or decommissioned

## Specific Duties

### 1. Carry Out Testing and Analysis

Manufacturers and importers must conduct or arrange:
- **Testing** of the plant, substance, or structure
- **Examination and analysis** as necessary to ensure safety

This ensures the product is safe before it enters the market.

**Construction Example:**
A manufacturer of scaffolding components must test load capacities, connection strengths, and durability under realistic working conditions before selling the product.

### 2. Provide Information

Must provide **adequate information** about:

**For Plant:**
- Purpose and intended use
- Results of testing and examinations
- Conditions necessary for safe use, transport, handling, storage, installation, construction, commissioning, maintenance, and disposal
- Known or foreseeable hazards and risks

**Construction Example - Concrete Cutting Equipment:**
Manufacturer must provide information about:
- Silica dust generation during use
- Required engineering controls (water suppression, dust extraction)
- PPE requirements
- Blade specifications and replacement intervals
- Safe operation procedures
- Maintenance requirements

**For Substances:**
- Health hazards and physical hazards
- Safe handling, storage, transport, and disposal
- [[Safety-Data-Sheets|Safety Data Sheets (SDS)]] for hazardous chemicals
- [[Labelling-Requirements|Correct labelling]]

**Construction Example - Chemical Products:**
Suppliers of adhesives, sealants, and coatings must provide:
- Safety Data Sheets identifying hazardous components
- Information about fumes and vapors
- Required ventilation and PPE
- Storage requirements (temperature, incompatible materials)
- First aid measures

### 3. Provide Information in Accessible Form

Information must be:
- In English (or other appropriate language)
- Clear and easily understandable
- Available when the product is supplied
- Updated if new hazards are identified

### 4. Keep Information Current

If the manufacturer/importer becomes aware that:
- Additional information is needed for safe use
- Information already provided is no longer adequate

They must provide revised information so far as reasonably practicable.

## Specific to Importers

Importers must ensure overseas manufacturers have complied with equivalent duties. This includes verifying:
- Appropriate testing has occurred
- Adequate information is available
- The product meets Australian standards where applicable

**Example - Imported Plant:**
An importer bringing in construction equipment from overseas must:
- Verify safety testing has been conducted
- Ensure operation manuals are translated to English
- Confirm equipment meets Australian electrical and safety standards
- Provide information about required guarding and safety devices

## Relationship with Designers

When manufacturers also [[Designers|design]] what they manufacture, they have both designer and manufacturer duties.

The design duty requires ensuring the design is safe; the manufacturer duty requires ensuring the manufactured product matches the safe design and has been properly tested.

## Relationship with Suppliers

[[Suppliers|Suppliers]] often rely on manufacturers and importers to fulfill their information duties. However, suppliers retain their own duty to ensure plant and substances are supplied safely.

## Installation and Commissioning

For plant requiring installation or commissioning, manufacturers must provide information about:
- Safe installation methods and sequence
- Commissioning requirements and safety checks
- Competencies required for installers

See [[Installers|Installer and Commissioner Duties]].

## Prohibited and Restricted Substances

Some substances cannot be imported, manufactured, or used due to WHS risks:
- Asbestos and asbestos-containing materials
- Certain chemicals banned under regulations

Manufacturers and importers must ensure compliance with prohibitions and restrictions.

## Practical Application

**Example: Manufacturing Mobile Scaffolding**

**Manufacturer duties include:**
1. **Testing:** Load testing platforms, testing stability under maximum height configurations, testing caster brakes
2. **Providing information:**
   - Maximum safe working load
   - Maximum height configurations
   - Safe assembly and disassembly instructions
   - Inspection and maintenance requirements
   - Required bracing and stabilizers
   - Unsafe conditions (e.g., must not be used on slopes)

**Example: Importing Power Tools**

**Importer duties include:**
1. **Verification:** Confirm manufacturer has tested products, verify compliance with Australian electrical standards
2. **Testing:** Conduct additional testing for Australian conditions if necessary
3. **Information:** Provide English manuals, safety warnings, maintenance information, required PPE
4. **Standards:** Ensure products meet Australian safety standards and regulations
