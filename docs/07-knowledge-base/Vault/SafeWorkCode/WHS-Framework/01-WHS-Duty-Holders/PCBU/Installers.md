# Installers, Constructors, and Commissioners - WHS Duties

## Who is an Installer?

An installer is a person who conducts a business or undertaking that includes installing, erecting, or commissioning **plant** or **structures** at a workplace.

This includes:
- Plant installers and erectors
- Building constructors
- Scaffold erectors
- Formwork erectors
- Crane riggers
- Plant commissioners
- Demolition contractors (as reverse constructors)

## Primary Duty

Installers must ensure, **so far as is reasonably practicable**, that the plant or structure is **without risks to health and safety** when installed, erected, or commissioned.

## Specific Duties for Installation and Erection

### 1. Install in Accordance with Information

Installers must install or erect plant and structures:
- In accordance with information provided by [[Designers|designers]], [[Manufacturers|manufacturers]], or [[Suppliers|suppliers]]
- Following design specifications
- Using specified methods and sequences
- Meeting required standards

**Construction Example - Scaffold Erection:**
Scaffold erectors must follow the manufacturer's assembly instructions, use specified bracing and ties, achieve required load capacities, and install edge protection as designed.

**Construction Example - Formwork Installation:**
Formwork erectors must follow design drawings showing required bracing, supports, tie locations, and erection sequence to ensure the formwork can safely support concrete loads.

### 2. Conduct Testing and Analysis

Installers must ensure testing, examination, or analysis is carried out:
- As necessary to verify safe installation
- As specified by designers or manufacturers
- To confirm the installation meets safety requirements

**Construction Example - Crane Installation:**
After erecting a tower crane, installers must conduct:
- Load testing to verify capacity
- Stability testing
- Function testing of safety devices
- Inspection of all connections and pins

### 3. Provide Information

Installers must give adequate information about:
- How the plant or structure was installed or erected
- Any conditions necessary for safe use
- Any residual risks or hazards
- Inspection and maintenance requirements

**Construction Example - Structural Steel Erection:**
Steel erectors must provide information to the principal contractor about:
- Temporary bracing that must remain until permanent connections are complete
- Load restrictions before concrete floors are poured
- Required inspections before removing temporary supports

## Specific Duties for Commissioning

### What is Commissioning?

Commissioning is the process of testing and verifying that plant operates correctly and safely before it is put into service.

### Commissioner Duties

Commissioners must ensure plant is commissioned:
- In accordance with manufacturer's instructions
- So that it operates safely
- With all safety systems functional

**Construction Example - HVAC System:**
Commissioners of building HVAC systems must verify:
- All safety interlocks function correctly
- Emergency stops operate as designed
- Ventilation rates meet design specifications
- Control systems operate correctly
- Safe access to filters and components for maintenance

## Installation Risk Management

Installers must apply the [[_Risk-Management-Overview|risk management process]] to installation work:

### 1. Identify Installation Hazards

**Common installation hazards:**
- Working at heights during installation
- Manual handling of heavy components
- Working in confined spaces
- Use of lifting equipment
- Electrical hazards during installation
- Collision with installed components
- Structural instability during installation

### 2. Assess Installation Risks

Consider:
- Likelihood of injury during installation work
- Potential severity of injuries
- Number of workers exposed
- Duration of exposure

### 3. Control Installation Risks

Apply the [[Step-3-Control-Risks|hierarchy of control]] to installation activities.

**Construction Example - Prefabricated Building Installation:**
- **Elimination:** Assemble sections at ground level before lifting
- **Engineering controls:** Use crane with load-indicating device, design temporary bracing
- **Administrative controls:** Develop lift plan, exclusion zones, competent doggers and riggers
- **PPE:** Harnesses for workers guiding components into position

### 4. Maintain and Review

- Monitor installation activities
- Review procedures after incidents or near-misses
- Update methods based on learnings

## Coordination with Other Duty Holders

### With Designers

Installers must:
- Request design information if not provided
- Seek clarification if design information is inadequate
- Report back to designers if safety issues are identified

[[Designers|Designers]] must:
- Provide installation information and sequences
- Specify requirements for temporary works
- Consider installation risks in their designs

### With Suppliers

[[Suppliers|Suppliers]] must provide information needed for safe installation.

Installers must request this information and not proceed if information is inadequate.

### With Principal Contractors

When working as a subcontractor, installers must:
- Coordinate with the principal contractor
- Provide information about risks their work creates
- Follow site safety requirements
- Participate in site consultation processes

See [[_Consultation-Overview|Consultation, Cooperation, and Coordination]].

## Competence Requirements

Installers must be competent to perform installation work. This includes:

**For High-Risk Work:**
- Appropriate licensing (scaffolding, rigging, dogging, cranes)
- Currency of skills and knowledge
- Familiarity with specific equipment or systems

**For Specialized Installation:**
- Manufacturer training for specific products
- Understanding of design requirements
- Knowledge of relevant standards and codes

**Construction Example:**
Installing formwork for a bridge requires understanding of:
- Structural loads and load paths
- Formwork design drawings
- Bracing and support requirements
- Concrete pouring sequences and rates
- Inspection points before concrete placement

## Common Installation Risks

### Structural Instability During Installation

Many structures are unstable until fully erected or until permanent connections are complete.

**Controls Required:**
- Temporary bracing and supports
- Staged installation sequences
- Restrictions on removing temporary supports
- Monitoring for movement or deflection

**Construction Example - Steel Frame:**
Steel building frames may require temporary bracing until floor slabs provide lateral stability. Erection procedures must specify bracing requirements and when bracing can be removed.

### Fall Risks During Installation

Installing structures and plant often involves working at height.

**Controls Required:**
- Work platforms and scaffolding
- Temporary edge protection
- Travel restraint or fall arrest systems
- Lift plans to minimize work at height

**Construction Example - Facade Installation:**
Installing building facades requires:
- Appropriate scaffolding or elevated work platforms
- Edge protection on floor slabs
- Anchor points for fall arrest systems
- Methods to safely guide panels into position

### Lifting and Rigging Risks

Installation often requires cranes and lifting equipment.

**Controls Required:**
- Lift plans for complex or heavy lifts
- Licensed riggers and doggers
- Load-rated lifting gear
- Exclusion zones during lifts
- Communication systems between ground crew and crane operator

See [[Managing-Risks-of-Plant|Managing Risks of Plant]].

## Demolition as Reverse Construction

Demolition contractors are constructors working in reverse - they must ensure the structure remains stable throughout demolition.

**Demolition installer duties:**
- Conduct demolition in accordance with a planned sequence
- Provide temporary supports as required
- Control dust, noise, and falling debris
- Ensure structural stability throughout demolition process

See [[Demolition-Work|Demolition Work Code of Practice]].

## Practical Application

**Scenario: Installing Commercial HVAC System**

**Installer Duties:**
1. **Review information:** Obtain and review design drawings, manufacturer information, installation specifications
2. **Plan installation:** Develop installation sequence considering access, lifting, and connection work
3. **Risk assessment:** Identify hazards (work at height on roof, lifting heavy units, refrigerant handling, electrical connections)
4. **Implement controls:** Scaffolding for roof work, crane lift plan, licensed electricians, refrigerant handling procedures
5. **Install to specification:** Follow design and manufacturer requirements
6. **Test and commission:** Verify system operates correctly, safety devices function, required ventilation achieved
7. **Provide information:** Handover information about maintenance access, operating parameters, inspection requirements
