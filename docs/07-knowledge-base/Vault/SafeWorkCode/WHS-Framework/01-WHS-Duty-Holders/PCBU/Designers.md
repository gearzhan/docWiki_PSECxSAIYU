# Designers - WHS Duties

## Who is a Designer?

A designer is a person who conducts a business or undertaking that includes designing:
- **Plant** (machinery, equipment, appliances, implements, tools)
- **Structures** (buildings, bridges, scaffolding, formwork, falsework)
- **Substances** (for use at work)

Designers include:
- Architects
- Structural engineers
- Design engineers
- Product designers
- Drafters who prepare technical drawings
- Anyone who specifies materials or methods that affect design

> [!note] Broad Definition
> Anyone who prepares a design or modifies a design is a designer under WHS law, regardless of their job title.

## Primary Design Duty

Designers must ensure, **so far as is reasonably practicable**, that the structure, plant, or substance is designed to be **without risks to health and safety** when:
- Used for its intended purpose
- Constructed, installed, or manufactured
- Properly maintained
- Decommissioned or disposed of

## Specific Design Duties

### 1. Eliminate or Minimise Risks

Designers must eliminate risks or, if that is not reasonably practicable, minimise risks associated with:

**For Structures:**
- Construction, installation, commissioning
- Use for intended purpose
- Demolition, dismantling, or disposal

**Construction Example - Pre-fabrication:**
Designing building components to be assembled at ground level eliminates fall risks during construction. Instead of workers installing trusses at height, complete roof sections can be lifted into place by crane after ground-level assembly.

**Construction Example - Permanent Edge Protection:**
Designing buildings with integrated permanent edge protection (parapets, guardrails) eliminates fall risks during construction and future maintenance work.

**For Plant:**
- Installation, commissioning, and use
- Cleaning and maintenance access
- Decommissioning or disposal

**Example - Maintenance Access:**
Designing plant with safe access platforms, walkways, and guardrails eliminates risks when workers perform routine maintenance, cleaning, or inspections.

**For Substances:**
- Handling, storage, and use
- Disposal

### 2. Test and Analyze

Designers must carry out, or arrange for others to carry out:
- **Calculations** necessary to ensure safety
- **Analysis** of the design
- **Testing** if necessary to ensure safety

This applies to both new designs and modifications to existing designs.

**Construction Example:**
A structural engineer must calculate load capacities for formwork systems, analyze stress points in temporary bracing, and verify designs meet relevant standards before construction begins.

### 3. Provide Information

Designers must give **adequate information** about:

**For the design:**
- Purpose for which the structure/plant/substance was designed
- Results of calculations, analysis, and testing
- Conditions necessary for safe use
- Any foreseeable risks that have not been eliminated

**For safe use:**
- How to construct, install, commission, use, maintain, and decommission safely
- Control measures that must be implemented

**Information must be provided to:**
- The person who commissioned the design
- Any other person prescribed by regulations

**Construction Example:**
An architect designing a building must provide:
- Structural drawings showing load capacities
- Specifications for fall protection anchor points
- Sequence for safe demolition/deconstruction at end of life
- Hazard warnings for materials requiring special handling

> [!important] Information Throughout Lifecycle
> Design information must support safe work through construction, use, maintenance, and eventual demolition or disposal.

### 4. Keep Information Current

If the designer becomes aware that:
- Additional information is required for safe use
- The information provided is no longer accurate or sufficient

The designer must, so far as reasonably practicable, provide **updated information** to relevant persons.

## Reasonably Practicable for Designers

Designers must consider:
- **Likelihood and severity** of potential injuries or harm
- **Current knowledge** about hazards, risks, and control measures
- **Availability and suitability** of safer designs and materials
- **Cost** of implementing safer design options (balanced against the risk)

> [!tip] Early Design Decisions Most Cost-Effective
> Incorporating safety in initial design is almost always less expensive than retrofitting controls later or managing risks during construction and use.

## Design for Construction Industry

### Safe Design of Structures

See [[Safe-Design-of-Structures|Safe Design of Structures]] for detailed guidance on designing buildings and structures for safe construction.

**Key Principles:**
1. **Eliminate work at heights** where possible (prefabrication, ground-level assembly)
2. **Design in permanent safety features** (anchor points, guardrails, access platforms)
3. **Consider construction sequence** and temporary works requirements
4. **Specify appropriate materials** to minimize hazards (e.g., lower silica content)
5. **Design for future maintenance** with safe access and work platforms

**Construction Example - Roof Design:**
Instead of designing a complex roof requiring extensive work at height:
- Design roof sections for ground-level prefabrication
- Include permanent anchor points for future maintenance
- Provide safe access to plant and equipment on roof
- Design parapets to provide permanent edge protection

### Scaffolding and Temporary Works Design

Designers of scaffolding, formwork, and falsework must:
- Design for intended loads including materials, workers, and equipment
- Specify safe erection and dismantling sequences
- Provide clear assembly drawings and instructions
- Specify inspection and maintenance requirements
- Consider environmental loads (wind, weather)

**Example - Formwork Design:**
A formwork designer must provide:
- Drawings showing assembly sequence
- Load capacity calculations
- Bracing and tie requirements
- Inspection points before concrete pouring
- Dismantling sequence to prevent collapse

## Integration with Other Duties

### Designers and Manufacturers

When designers also [[Manufacturers|manufacture]] what they design, they have both designer and manufacturer duties.

### Designers and Principal Contractors

Principal contractors must provide designers with relevant information about:
- Site conditions
- Work that will be carried out near the structure
- Any factors that may affect the design

This allows designers to address foreseeable risks in their designs.

### Designers and Installers

[[Installers|Installers]] rely on design information to safely erect structures and plant. Inadequate design information transfers risk to installers and workers.

## Common Design Failings

> [!warning] Design Risks to Avoid
> - No consideration of construction methodology
> - No provision for safe access during construction and maintenance
> - No information about safe construction sequences
> - Inadequate temporary works specifications
> - Failing to specify control measures for hazardous materials
> - Designing work that requires high-risk activities without considering alternatives

## Practical Application

**Project: Multi-Story Office Building**

**Designer Duties Include:**
1. **Eliminate risks:**
   - Design floor slabs for prefabrication to reduce work at height
   - Specify materials with lower silica content

2. **Design in permanent controls:**
   - Roof anchor points for maintenance access
   - Internal access to roof plant rooms
   - Fall protection on balconies and elevated areas

3. **Provide information:**
   - Construction methodology and sequence
   - Temporary edge protection requirements during construction
   - Load capacity for construction loads
   - Safe demolition sequence for end-of-life

4. **Coordinate with others:**
   - Consult with principal contractor about site conditions
   - Provide information to subcontractors (façade, services, etc.)
   - Coordinate with engineers designing temporary works
