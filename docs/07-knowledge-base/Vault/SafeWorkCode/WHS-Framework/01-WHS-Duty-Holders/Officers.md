# Officers - Due Diligence Duties

## Who is an Officer?

An **officer** of a PCBU is a person who:
- Makes decisions, or participates in making decisions, that affect the whole or a substantial part of the business
- Has the capacity to significantly affect the financial standing of the business

**Officers typically include:**
- Company directors (executive and non-executive)
- Partners in a partnership
- Chief Executive Officers
- Chief Financial Officers
- Other senior executives with strategic decision-making authority

> [!important] Not Based on Title
> Whether someone is an "officer" depends on their actual role and authority, not their job title.

## Officer's Duty of Due Diligence

Officers have a duty to exercise **due diligence** to ensure the PCBU complies with its WHS duties and obligations.

This is a personal duty - officers cannot delegate or contract out of it.

> [!warning] Personal Liability
> Officers can be personally prosecuted and penalized for failing to exercise due diligence, even if they were not directly involved in the incident.

## What is Due Diligence?

Due diligence means taking reasonable steps to:

### 1. Acquire and Keep Up-to-Date Knowledge

**Officers must understand:**
- WHS matters relevant to the business operations
- Nature of the industry and its hazards
- Legal obligations under WHS legislation
- Current WHS risks in the business

**Practical steps:**
- Attend WHS training and briefings
- Review industry guidance and codes of practice
- Stay informed about emerging WHS issues
- Understand the business's specific hazards

**Construction Example:**
Directors of a construction company must understand high-risk construction work, common construction hazards (falls, plant, electrical, manual handling), and relevant construction codes of practice.

### 2. Understand Operations and Hazards

**Officers must understand:**
- The nature of operations being carried out
- Hazards and risks associated with those operations
- How those risks are being controlled

**This requires:**
- Site visits and workplace inspections
- Reviewing incident reports and trends
- Understanding what work is actually being done
- Knowing major projects and activities

**Construction Example:**
A director should visit construction sites, understand the type of work being performed (excavation, concrete, steelwork, etc.), and be aware of site-specific risks (proximity to power lines, confined spaces, work over water).

### 3. Ensure Appropriate Resources and Processes

**Officers must ensure the PCBU has:**
- **Resources** to eliminate or minimise WHS risks:
  - Adequate budget for WHS controls
  - Sufficient competent WHS personnel
  - Appropriate equipment and technology
  - Time to implement controls properly

- **Processes** for eliminating or minimising WHS risks:
  - Risk management systems
  - Consultation mechanisms
  - Safe work procedures
  - Emergency response procedures
  - Incident investigation processes

**Construction Example:**
Directors must ensure:
- Budget allocates funds for scaffolding, edge protection, and safety equipment
- WHS manager or coordinator is appointed
- Project planning includes time for safe work method statements
- Consultation processes with workers are established
- Systems exist for managing subcontractors

### 4. Ensure Appropriate Information and Reporting

**Officers must ensure:**
- Information about WHS matters is received and considered in a timely way
- Processes exist for receiving information about:
  - Incidents, injuries, and near-misses
  - Hazards identified
  - WHS compliance issues
  - Progress on implementing controls
  - Changes affecting WHS risks

**Practical implementation:**
- Regular WHS reports to board or management meetings
- Systems for escalating serious incidents
- Reporting on key WHS performance indicators
- Reviews of WHS audit findings

**Construction Example:**
Board meetings should include:
- Reports on incidents and injuries
- High-risk work being undertaken
- Results of WHS inspections
- Compliance with SWMS requirements
- Subcontractor WHS performance

### 5. Ensure Incidents are Reported and Investigated

**Officers must ensure processes exist for:**
- Promptly reporting notifiable incidents to the regulator
- Investigating incidents to identify root causes
- Implementing corrective actions
- Reviewing effectiveness of existing controls

**Construction Example:**
When a worker falls from height, the officer's due diligence requires ensuring:
- Incident is notified to SafeWork NSW
- Site is preserved for investigation
- Thorough investigation identifies causes
- Corrective actions are implemented across all sites
- Findings are communicated to relevant personnel

### 6. Ensure Compliance Processes are Implemented

**Officers must ensure:**
- Systems and processes exist to achieve compliance with WHS duties
- Those systems are actually implemented and followed
- Non-compliance is identified and addressed

**This includes:**
- WHS policies and procedures
- Induction and training programs
- Inspection and audit programs
- Contractor management systems
- Competency verification processes
- Document control systems

**Construction Example:**
Officers must ensure:
- All workers receive site induction
- High-risk work licenses are verified
- Safe work method statements are prepared and followed
- Plant is inspected and maintained
- Consultation occurs before work commences

## Due Diligence is Proactive

Due diligence requires **proactive steps** - not just reacting to incidents after they occur.

**Officers must:**
- Anticipate risks before they materialize
- Question whether current controls are adequate
- Seek assurance that systems are working
- Verify compliance, not just assume it

> [!tip] Trust but Verify
> Officers can rely on competent managers and advisors, but must verify that systems are working through regular reporting, audits, and oversight.

## What Due Diligence Looks Like in Practice

### Board/Management Meeting Practices

**WHS should be a standing agenda item:**
- Reviewed at start of meeting (not rushed at end)
- Officers ask probing questions
- Trends and systemic issues are discussed
- Resources for WHS controls are approved

**Construction Example - Board Meeting:**
- Review incident statistics and trends
- Discuss upcoming high-risk projects and controls
- Approve budget for fall protection equipment
- Review results of site WHS audits
- Consider reports on subcontractor WHS performance

### Site Visits and Workplace Inspections

**Officers should:**
- Visit workplaces regularly
- Observe work activities firsthand
- Talk to workers about WHS concerns
- Check whether procedures are being followed
- Identify gaps between policies and practice

**Construction Example:**
During a site visit, a director observes:
- Whether edge protection is installed on elevated floors
- Workers wearing required PPE
- Safe work method statements displayed
- Plant inspection tags current
- Workers able to explain WHS procedures

### Reviewing Information and Reports

**Officers should receive and review:**
- Incident reports (including near-misses)
- Results of WHS inspections and audits
- Consultation meeting minutes
- Training completion rates
- Compliance with regulatory requirements

### Asking the Right Questions

**Effective officers ask:**
- "What are our highest WHS risks and how are they controlled?"
- "Have we allocated sufficient resources for WHS?"
- "How do we know our controls are working?"
- "What are workers telling us about WHS?"
- "Are we compliant with relevant codes of practice?"

## Due Diligence Does Not Require

**Officers are not expected to:**
- Become WHS experts
- Personally conduct risk assessments
- Personally develop procedures
- Be present at workplaces daily
- Have operational control over day-to-day activities

**However, officers must:**
- Ensure competent people are doing those tasks
- Verify that systems are in place and working
- Hold managers accountable for WHS performance

## Relationship with PCBU Duties

**The PCBU** (company, business) has the primary duty to ensure health and safety.

**Officers** have a duty to exercise due diligence to ensure the PCBU complies with its primary duty.

**Both can be prosecuted:**
- The PCBU for failing to comply with its primary duty
- The officer for failing to exercise due diligence

> [!example] Example
> If a worker is seriously injured due to inadequate fall protection:
> - The company (PCBU) can be prosecuted for failing to provide a safe workplace
> - The directors (officers) can be prosecuted if they failed to ensure the company had adequate systems and resources for managing fall risks

## Penalties for Failing to Exercise Due Diligence

**Officers who fail to exercise due diligence face:**

**Category 2 offence (exposing to risk):**
- Fines up to $300,000
- Imprisonment up to 5 years (in serious cases)

**Category 3 offence (other failures):**
- Fines up to $100,000

## Demonstrating Due Diligence

**Officers should document evidence of due diligence:**
- Attendance at WHS training
- Records of site visits
- Board meeting minutes showing WHS discussions
- Approvals for WHS resources and budgets
- Responses to WHS reports and recommendations
- Actions taken in response to incidents

This documentation demonstrates proactive engagement if due diligence is ever questioned.

## Practical Application

**Due diligence activities include:**

1. **Knowledge:**
   - Complete directors' WHS training
   - Review construction codes of practice
   - Understand company's highest risks (falls, excavation, plant)

2. **Understanding operations:**
   - Visit sites quarterly
   - Review major project plans
   - Understand types of work being performed

3. **Resources and processes:**

   - Approve appointment of WHS manager
   - Ensure systems exist for SWMS preparation and review

4. **Information and reporting:**
   - Require monthly WHS report to board
   - Ensure incidents are reported within 24 hours
   - Review key WHS indicators (injuries, near-misses, audit findings)

5. **Incident investigation:**
   - Ensure notifiable incidents are reported to SafeWork NSW
   - Review investigation findings
   - Verify corrective actions are implemented

6. **Compliance:**
   - Ensure high-risk work licenses are verified
