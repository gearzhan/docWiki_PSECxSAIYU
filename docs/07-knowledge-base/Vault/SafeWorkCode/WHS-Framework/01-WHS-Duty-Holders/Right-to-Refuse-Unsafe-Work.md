# Right to Refuse Unsafe Work

## Worker Right to Cease Work

Workers have a **right to cease or refuse to carry out work** if they have a **reasonable concern** that continuing the work would expose them to a **serious risk to their health or safety** from an immediate or imminent hazard.

> [!important] Legal Right (WHS Act s.84)
> A worker may cease, or refuse to carry out, work if the worker has a reasonable concern that to carry out the work would expose the worker to a serious risk to the worker's health or safety, emanating from an immediate or imminent exposure to a hazard.

This right protects workers from being required to work in dangerous conditions.

**Reference:** WHS Act s.84-85

## When Workers Can Refuse Work

### Conditions Required

Worker must have **reasonable concern** about:
1. **Serious risk** to health or safety
2. From **immediate or imminent** exposure to hazard

**All three elements must be present:**

**1. Reasonable Concern:**
- Based on worker's knowledge, experience, and the circumstances
- Genuine belief about the risk
- Does not need to be correct (but must be reasonable)

**2. Serious Risk:**
- Risk that could result in death, serious injury, or serious illness
- Not minor or trivial risks

**3. Immediate or Imminent:**
- Hazard is present now or about to occur
- Not future or potential hazards that can be controlled before work commences

---

## Examples of When Right Applies

### Construction Examples

**✅ Appropriate to refuse:**

**Scaffolding collapse risk:**
- Scaffold partially collapsed overnight (strong winds)
- Worker refuses to access scaffold until engineer inspects
- **Reasonable:** Visible damage, serious fall risk, immediate hazard

**Trench collapse:**
- Heavy rain overnight, water pooling in trench
- Ground cracking at trench edge
- Worker refuses to enter until benching/shoring installed
- **Reasonable:** Ground instability, serious crush risk, imminent collapse hazard

**Electrical hazard:**
- Exposed live wiring discovered in switchboard
- Electrician refuses to work until power isolated
- **Reasonable:** Electrocution risk, immediate hazard

**Falling object risk:**
- Work being performed overhead, objects falling
- Workers below refuse to continue until overhead work stopped or catch platforms installed
- **Reasonable:** Serious head injury risk, immediate falling object hazard

---

### When Right May NOT Apply

**❌ Not appropriate to refuse (examples):**

**Future risk with controls available:**
- Working at heights task tomorrow with fall arrest system available
- Risk can be controlled before work commences
- Not immediate or imminent hazard

**Minor risk:**
- Minor cut risk from hand tools (normal work risk)
- Not serious risk

**Unreasonable concern:**
- Concern not based on actual hazard
- Worker refuses all work at heights despite appropriate controls in place and training provided

---

## Procedure When Ceasing Work

### Worker Actions

**If you have reasonable concern about serious, immediate risk:**

1. **Cease work immediately**
   - Stop performing the hazardous task
   - Move to safe location
   - Do not place yourself or others at risk

2. **Notify supervisor/PCBU**
   - Explain concern clearly
   - Describe the hazard
   - State why you believe it's a serious risk

3. **Notify HSR** (if there is one for your work group)
   - HSR can assist in raising issue
   - HSR may have power to direct cessation of unsafe work

4. **Remain available**
   - Stay on site (unless unsafe to do so)
   - Participate in resolving the issue
   - Available for consultation

---

### PCBU/Supervisor Response

**When worker ceases work:**

1. **Take worker's concern seriously**
   - Listen to explanation
   - Do not dismiss or minimize concern

2. **Assess the situation**
   - Inspect the hazard
   - Determine if serious risk exists
   - Consider worker's experience and perspective

3. **If serious risk confirmed:**
   - Implement controls before work resumes
   - May require engineering assessment, additional equipment, changed work method
   - Consult with worker and HSR

4. **If no serious risk identified:**
   - Explain why you believe work is safe
   - Demonstrate controls in place
   - Provide additional information or training if needed
   - Try to resolve worker's concern

5. **If disagreement continues:**
   - Follow issue resolution procedures
   - May request inspector to attend
   - Worker can continue to refuse until matter resolved

---

## Issue Resolution Process

**If worker and PCBU disagree** about whether serious risk exists:

### Step 1: Discussion
- Worker, supervisor, HSR (if applicable) discuss issue
- Attempt to reach agreement on controls or safety of work

### Step 2: Senior Management
- If unresolved, escalate to senior manager
- Further discussion and assessment

### Step 3: Inspector
- Either party can request WorkSafe inspector to attend
- Inspector assesses situation
- Inspector may issue notice or take other action

**During resolution process:**
- Worker not required to perform disputed work
- Worker entitled to be paid
- Worker may be directed to perform alternative work (if available and safe)

**Reference:** WHS Act s.80-82 (Issue Resolution)

---

## Worker Protections

### No Adverse Action

**PCBU must NOT:**
- Dismiss worker for refusing unsafe work
- Discipline worker for exercising this right
- Discriminate against worker
- Reduce hours or pay

**If worker exercised right reasonably and in good faith.**

**It is an offence** under WHS Act to take adverse action against worker for exercising WHS rights.

---

### Payment During Work Refusal

**Worker entitled to be paid** for time not working if:
- Refusal was based on reasonable concern
- Worker remained available
- Worker participated in resolving issue

**PCBU may direct worker to perform alternative safe work** during this time.

---

## HSR Power to Direct Cessation

**Health and Safety Representatives have additional power:**

**HSR may direct workers to cease work** if HSR reasonably believes:
- Work involves serious risk
- From immediate or imminent exposure to hazard

**HSR direction:**
- Must be in writing (or confirmed in writing as soon as practicable)
- Workers must comply with HSR direction
- Work ceases until matter resolved

**PCBU must NOT** direct workers to resume work until:
- Matter resolved, **OR**
- Inspector attends and authorizes resumption

**Reference:** WHS Act s.85

## Practical Construction Examples

### Example 1: Scaffold Safety Concern

**Situation:**
Carpenter arrives at work, notices scaffold has missing bracing and leans noticeably.

**Worker actions:**
1. Refuses to access scaffold
2. Notifies supervisor: "Scaffold is unstable, bracing missing, serious fall risk"
3. Notifies HSR

**Supervisor response:**
1. Inspects scaffold with HSR
2. Confirms bracing missing (removed by another trade)
3. Agrees serious fall risk exists
4. Tags scaffold "DO NOT USE"
5. Contacts scaffolder to repair

**Outcome:**
- Scaffolder reinstalls bracing, inspects scaffold
- Supervisor and HSR inspect, agree now safe
- Work resumes
- Carpenter's refusal was reasonable, no adverse action

---

### Example 2: Trench Collapse Risk

**Situation:**
Excavation crew arrives after heavy rain. Trench has water pooling, ground cracking at edge.

**HSR actions:**
1. HSR observes conditions
2. Reasonably believes serious risk (trench collapse, workers crushed)
3. **Issues direction to cease work**
4. Direction confirmed in writing: "Work to cease until geotechnical assessment completed and shoring/benching installed"

**PCBU response:**
1. Work ceases immediately
2. PCBU engages geotechnical engineer
3. Engineer recommends benching and shoring
4. Controls implemented
5. HSR and workers consulted, agree controls adequate
6. Work resumes

**Outcome:**
- Serious injury prevented
- HSR exercised power appropriately
- Issue resolved through controls

---

### Example 3: Electrical Hazard

**Situation:**
Electrician opens switchboard for maintenance, discovers exposed live wiring (previous work not completed properly).

**Electrician actions:**
1. Immediately ceases work
2. Closes switchboard (does not touch live wiring)
3. Notifies supervisor: "Live exposed wiring, serious electrocution risk"
4. Refuses to work until power isolated

**Supervisor response:**
1. Views hazard (from safe distance)
2. Confirms serious risk
3. Arranges power isolation
4. Allows electrician to make safe
5. Investigates how hazard occurred

**Outcome:**
- Power isolated, electrician makes safe
- Incident investigation identifies training gap for previous tradesperson
- Electrician's refusal was appropriate, prevented potential electrocution

---

### Example 4: Dispute Resolution

**Situation:**
Worker refuses to operate excavator, claims hydraulic leak creates fire risk.

**Initial response:**
- Supervisor inspects, finds minor hydraulic weeping (not active leak)
- Supervisor believes no immediate fire risk, asks worker to continue
- Worker disagrees, maintains refusal

**Issue resolution process:**
1. **Discussion:** Supervisor, worker, HSR discuss. No agreement.
2. **Escalation:** Site manager called, inspects excavator. Agrees with supervisor (minor weep, not immediate risk), but acknowledges worker's concern.
3. **Proposed solution:** Site manager offers alternative excavator while original sent for repair. Worker agrees.
4. **Outcome:** Worker operates alternative excavator (paid for day), original excavator repaired. Dispute resolved without inspector.
