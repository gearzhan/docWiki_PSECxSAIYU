**Subcontractor principal/supervisor:**
- Must ensure own workers inducted
- Coordinates with principal contractor on access, hazards

## Compliance Monitoring

### Visitor Management Checks

**Daily:**

- Visitor PPE compliance (during site walkthrough)
- Escorts performing duties

**Weekly:**
- Review induction records (all visitors inducted?)
- Visitor incident/near-miss review
- Induction content currency (new hazards emerged?)

**Monthly:**
- Audit visitor management system
- Review visitor numbers/types (trends)
- Improve procedures if needed
