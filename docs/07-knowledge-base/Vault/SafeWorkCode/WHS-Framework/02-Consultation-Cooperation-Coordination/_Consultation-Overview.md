# Consultation, Cooperation, and Coordination Overview

## Why Consultation Matters

Consultation is both a **legal requirement** and an **essential part** of managing health and safety risks.

A safe workplace is more easily achieved when everyone involved in the work:
- Communicates to identify hazards and risks
- Talks about health and safety concerns
- Works together to find solutions

> [!important] Legal Requirement
> PCBUs must consult with workers under section 47 of the WHS Act, and must consult, cooperate, and coordinate with other duty holders under section 46.

## Benefits of Effective Consultation

### Better Decision-Making

Workers have direct knowledge and experience of:
- How work is actually performed (versus how procedures describe it)
- Practical challenges and workarounds
- Near-misses and close calls
- What controls work and what don't

**Construction Example:**
Scaffolders know which scaffold configurations are stable, where additional bracing is needed on particular sites, and how weather conditions affect safety. Their input improves scaffold design and erection procedures.

### Greater Awareness and Commitment

Workers who participate in health and safety decisions:
- Better understand why controls are necessary
- Are more likely to follow procedures they helped develop
- Take ownership of safety outcomes
- Identify improvements proactively

### Positive Working Relationships

Consultation builds:
- Trust between management and workers
- Cooperation across teams and trades
- Understanding of different perspectives
- Shared commitment to safety

## Two Types of Duties

### 1. [[Consultation-with-Workers|Consultation with Workers]]

**PCBUs must consult** with workers who:
- Carry out work for the business or undertaking
- Are (or are likely to be) directly affected by a health and safety matter

This includes employees, contractors, subcontractors, labour hire workers, apprentices, trainees, and volunteers.

**When consultation is required:**
- Identifying hazards and assessing risks
- Deciding on control measures
- Determining adequacy of welfare facilities
- Proposing changes affecting health and safety
- Developing consultation procedures
- Resolving health and safety issues
- Monitoring health and workplace conditions
- Providing information and training

### 2. [[Cooperation-and-Coordination|Cooperation and Coordination with Other Duty Holders]]

**PCBUs must consult, cooperate, and coordinate** with other duty holders who have WHS duties for the same matter.

**Why this matters:**
- Multiple PCBUs often share responsibility for the same workers or workplace
- Without coordination, gaps and overlaps in controls occur
- Duty holders may assume someone else is managing a risk
- Activities of one PCBU can create or increase risks for others

**Construction Example:**
At a construction site:
- Principal contractor coordinates site access and manages overall site safety
- Electrical subcontractor manages electrical work risks
- Scaffolding company ensures scaffolding is safe
- Crane hire company ensures crane is maintained and operated safely
- All must coordinate to ensure, for example, that scaffolding doesn't interfere with crane operations and electrical work doesn't create hazards for workers on scaffolding

## Who Has Consultation Duties?

### [[PCBU-Overview|Persons Conducting a Business or Undertaking (PCBUs)]]

PCBUs must:
- Consult with their workers
- Consult, cooperate, and coordinate with other PCBUs sharing WHS duties

### [[Designers|Designers, Manufacturers, Importers, Suppliers]]

Must consult during design, manufacture, and supply processes:
- Manufacturers must consult with designers
- Importers must consult with designers and manufacturers
- Persons commissioning construction must consult with designers

### [[Officers|Officers]]

Officers must exercise due diligence to ensure:
- The PCBU has appropriate consultation processes
- Consultation processes are actually implemented
- Workers and other duty holders are genuinely consulted

### [[Workers|Workers]]

Workers must:
- Participate in consultation when requested
- Cooperate with consultation procedures
- Raise health and safety concerns
- Contribute their knowledge and experience

## What Makes Consultation Effective?

Effective consultation requires four key elements:

### 1. [[Effective-Consultation-Elements#Sharing Information|Sharing Information]]

**PCBUs must provide workers with:**
- Information about hazards and risks
- Technical information and safety data
- Incident reports and investigation findings
- Results of monitoring and inspections

**Workers must share:**
- Their observations and experiences
- Concerns about hazards and risks
- Ideas for improvements
- Feedback on effectiveness of controls

### 2. [[Effective-Consultation-Elements#Reasonable Opportunity|Reasonable Opportunity to Express Views]]

Workers must have genuine opportunities to:
- Express their views and concerns
- Contribute ideas and solutions
- Ask questions and seek clarification
- Challenge proposed approaches

**This requires:**
- Adequate time for consultation
- Accessible forums or meetings
- Language and format workers understand
- Freedom to speak without fear of reprisal

### 3. [[Effective-Consultation-Elements#Taking Views into Account|Taking Views into Account]]

Consultation is not genuine if workers' views are ignored.

PCBUs must:
- Genuinely consider workers' input
- Give proper weight to workers' experience
- Incorporate practical suggestions where possible
- Explain decisions if workers' suggestions are not adopted

### 4. [[Effective-Consultation-Elements#Advising Outcomes|Advising Outcomes of Consultation]]

Workers must be informed about:
- Decisions made following consultation
- Reasons for decisions
- How their input influenced decisions
- Actions that will be taken

**Construction Example - Scaffold Consultation:**
1. **Information sharing:** Principal contractor provides information about required scaffold configuration and loads
2. **Opportunity:** Scaffolders are asked for input during planning meeting before erection begins
3. **Taking views into account:** Scaffolders suggest additional ties for wind protection based on site exposure; this is incorporated into the scaffold plan
4. **Advising outcomes:** Updated scaffold plan is distributed showing modifications based on scaffolders' input

## Methods of Consultation

Consultation can occur through various methods:

### Direct Consultation

- **Toolbox talks** before starting work
- **Site meetings** to discuss upcoming work and hazards
- **One-on-one discussions** between supervisors and workers
- **Workplace inspections** involving workers
- **Suggestion schemes** allowing workers to submit ideas

### [[Health-and-Safety-Representatives|Health and Safety Representatives (HSRs)]]

Workers can elect HSRs to represent them in consultation.

**HSRs have powers to:**
- Represent workers in consultations with the PCBU
- Inspect the workplace
- Access health and safety information
- Accompany inspectors during workplace visits
- Issue provisional improvement notices (with training)
- Direct unsafe work to cease (in limited circumstances)

### [[WHS-Committees|WHS Committees]]

For larger workplaces or construction projects, WHS committees bring together:
- Worker representatives (including HSRs)
- Management representatives
- Specialist advisors (WHS professionals, occupational hygienists, etc.)

Committees can:
- Review incident trends
- Discuss systemic issues
- Develop WHS policies and procedures
- Monitor implementation of controls

## Consultation in Construction

Construction presents unique consultation challenges:
- Multiple PCBUs at one site
- Changing workforce as trades come and go
- Short project durations
- High-risk work requiring close coordination

### Principal Contractor Responsibilities

Principal contractors must:
- Document consultation arrangements in the [[WHS-Management-Plan|WHS Management Plan]]
- Establish site consultation processes (toolbox talks, site meetings)
- Facilitate consultation between subcontractors
- Ensure workers across all PCBUs can raise concerns

**Construction Example - Daily Toolbox Talk:**
Each morning before work commences:
- Discuss work planned for the day
- Identify hazards for the day's work
- Confirm control measures are in place
- Allow workers to raise concerns
- Confirm emergency procedures

## Common Consultation Failures

> [!warning] Ineffective Consultation
> - **Telling, not asking:** Informing workers of decisions already made is not consultation
> - **Token consultation:** Going through the motions without genuinely considering input
> - **Inadequate time:** Rushing consultation prevents meaningful participation
> - **Language barriers:** Not providing information in languages workers understand
> - **Fear of reprisal:** Workers afraid to speak up won't provide honest feedback
> - **Ignoring input:** Consistently disregarding workers' views discourages participation

## Documenting Consultation

While not always legally required, documenting consultation is advisable:

**Benefits of documentation:**
- Demonstrates compliance with consultation duties
- Provides record of decisions and rationale
- Allows tracking of actions arising from consultation
- Shows workers their input was considered

**What to document:**
- Who was consulted and when
- What matters were discussed
- What views workers expressed
- What decisions were made
- How workers' input influenced decisions
- Actions to be taken and by whom

## Consultation Throughout the Risk Management Process

Consultation should occur at each step of [[_Risk-Management-Overview|risk management]]:

1. **[[Step-1-Identify-Hazards|Identifying Hazards]]:** Workers identify hazards based on their experience
2. **[[Step-2-Assess-Risks|Assessing Risks]]:** Workers provide information about likelihood and consequences
3. **[[Step-3-Control-Risks|Controlling Risks]]:** Workers suggest practical controls and identify barriers to implementation
4. **[[Step-4-Maintain-and-Review|Reviewing Controls]]:** Workers provide feedback on whether controls are working
