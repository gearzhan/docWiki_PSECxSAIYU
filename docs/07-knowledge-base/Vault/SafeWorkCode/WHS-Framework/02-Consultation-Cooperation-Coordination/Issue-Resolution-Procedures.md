# Issue Resolution Procedures

## Resolving WHS Issues at the Workplace

When workers and PCBUs disagree about a WHS matter, **issue resolution procedures** provide a systematic process to resolve the dispute.

> [!important] WHS Act s.80-82
> Issue resolution procedures apply when agreement cannot be reached on WHS matter through consultation.

## Default Issue Resolution Procedure

**WHS Regulations set out default procedure** (unless agreed procedures developed).

### Step 1: Discussion Between Parties

**Parties involved:**
- Worker(s) raising issue
- PCBU representative (supervisor, manager)
- HSR (if worker represented by one)

**Process:**
- Discuss the issue
- Share information and views
- Attempt to reach agreement on:
  - Nature of issue
  - Control measures needed
  - Actions to be taken

**Timeframe:** Reasonable time for discussion (depends on urgency and complexity)

---

### Step 2: Escalation if Unresolved

**If Step 1 doesn't resolve issue:**
- Escalate to senior PCBU representative (senior manager, director)
- Further discussion
- Attempt to reach agreement

---

### Step 3: Request Inspector Assistance

**If Step 2 doesn't resolve issue:**

**Either party can request WorkSafe inspector to attend:**
- Worker, HSR, or PCBU can request
- Request to SafeWork NSW: 13 10 50

**Inspector actions:**
- Attends workplace
- Investigates issue
- Discusses with parties
- May:
  - Issue improvement notice
  - Issue prohibition notice
  - Provide advice
  - Take other action as appropriate

**Inspector's decision/notice is binding.**

**Agreed procedures must:**
- Be developed in consultation with workers and HSRs
- Be in writing
- Be readily accessible to workers
- Allow workers to be represented by HSR
- Provide for escalation if not resolved at first level

**Benefits of agreed procedures:**
- Tailored to workplace
- Clear expectations

## Practical Example - Scaffolding Dispute

**Issue:** Workers believe scaffolding unsafe (missing bracing). Supervisor believes safe for use.

**Step 1 - Discussion:**
- Workers, HSR, supervisor inspect scaffolding together
- Supervisor: "Bracing on different level, design allows this"
- HSR: "Workers not confident, appears unstable"
- No agreement reached

**Step 2 - Escalation:**
- Site manager called
- Reviews scaffolding design drawings
- Uncertainty remains about whether bracing adequate

**Step 3 - Inspector Requested:**
- HSR requests inspector (13 10 50)
- Inspector attends next day
- Inspector inspects scaffolding and reviews design
- Inspector determines bracing inadequate for configuration
- **Inspector issues improvement notice:** "Install additional bracing as per AS 1576 within 48 hours"

**Resolution:**
- Bracing installed as per notice
- Workers, HSR, supervisor inspect
- Agreement: Now compliant and safe
- Work resumes

**Outcome:** Issue resolved through structured process. Inspector's technical expertise resolved uncertainty.
