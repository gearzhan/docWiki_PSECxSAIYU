# Health and Safety Representatives (HSRs)

## Worker Representatives for WHS Matters

Health and Safety Representatives (HSRs) are **workers elected to represent their work group** on work health and safety matters.

> [!important] HSRs are Elected by Workers
> HSRs are not appointed by management. They are elected by workers to represent workers' interests in health and safety consultation.

**Reference:** [Code of Practice: Work health and safety consultation, cooperation and coordination](../../code%20of%20practice/WHS_consultation_cooperation_coordination.md)

## When HSRs Required

**WHS Act does NOT require HSRs unless requested by workers.**

**Trigger for establishing HSRs:**
- **One worker** requests election of HSR

**Once requested:**
1. PCBU must negotiate work groups with workers (within 14 days)
2. Elections held for each work group
3. HSR represents workers in that work group

**PCBU may also:**
- Alert workers to their right to elect HSRs (even without request)
- Encourage HSR elections

**Reference:** WHS Act s.51-53

---

## Establishing Work Groups

### Negotiation Process

**Purpose of negotiations:** Determine:
- Number and composition of work group(s)
- Number of HSRs and deputy HSRs (if any) to be elected
- Workplace(s) to which work groups apply

**Work group may operate across:**
- Multiple worksites
- Multiple businesses (if parties agree)

**PCBU must:**
- Take all reasonable steps to **commence negotiations within 14 days** after request
- Negotiate with worker's representative (e.g., union official) if worker requests
- **Notify workers of outcome** as soon as practicable

**If negotiations fail:**
Any party can ask regulator to appoint inspector to assist negotiations and determine matters.

**Reference:** WHS Act s.51-54

---

## Work Group Composition

**Factors to consider when negotiing work groups:**

- Nature of work performed
- Number and locations of workers
- Hazards and risks workers are exposed to
- Shift work or other working arrangements
- Number of workers at each workplace

**Example Approaches:**

**By trade/occupation:**
- Carpentry work group
- Concrete/formwork work group
- Services trades work group

**By location:**
- Level 1-3 work group
- Level 4-6 work group

**By shift:**
- Day shift work group
- Night shift work group

> [!example] Construction Site Work Groups
> Large construction site negotiates 5 work groups:
> - **Carpentry & Formwork** (25 workers)
> - **Concrete & Reinforcing** (18 workers)
> - **Services Trades** (electricians, plumbers, HVAC - 22 workers)
> - **Plant Operators & Laborers** (15 workers)
> - **Site Management & Administration** (12 workers)
>
> Each work group elects one HSR and one deputy HSR.

## Practical Construction Examples

### Example 1: HSR Inspecting Workplace

**Scenario:** HSR for services trades group receives complaint about electrical hazards (exposed wiring in switchboard).

**HSR actions:**
1. Gives PCBU reasonable notice of intention to inspect (morning toolbox talk)
2. Inspects switchboard area with complainant
3. Takes photos of exposed wiring
4. Discusses observations with site supervisor and electrical supervisor
5. Confirms PCBU will isolate switchboard and engage licensed electrician to rectify
6. Follows up next day to verify rectification

**Outcome:** Hazard corrected before anyone injured. HSR performed inspection function, PCBU cooperated, issue resolved.

### Example 2: HSR Issuing Provisional Improvement Notice

**Scenario:** HSR (completed approved training) observes scaffolding erected without required edge protection on top platform (3.5m high).

**HSR reasonably believes:** PCBU contravening WHS Regulation 4.4.9 (requirement for edge protection on scaffolding).

**HSR actions:**
1. Issues PIN requiring edge protection installed within 24 hours
2. Provides copy to PCBU and posts copy at workplace
3. Documents observations and regulatory requirement

**PCBU actions:**
1. Receives PIN
2. Immediately installs edge protection
3. Complies with PIN
4. Investigates why scaffolder did not install edge protection (training gap identified)

**Outcome:** Serious fall risk eliminated. HSR exercised power to issue PIN. PCBU complied and addressed underlying issue.

### Example 3: HSR Directing Cessation of Unsafe Work

**Scenario:** Excavation collapses near edge while workers in trench (1.5m deep). HSR for plant operators/laborers group observes ground cracking.

**HSR reasonably believes:** Continuing work involves **serious risk from immediate/imminent exposure** to further collapse.

**HSR actions:**
1. Directs workers to cease work and evacuate trench immediately
2. Establishes exclusion zone
3. Notifies PCBU and supervisor
4. Requests geotechnical assessment before work resumes

**PCBU actions:**
1. Supports HSR decision
2. Engages geotechnical engineer
3. Engineer recommends benching and shoring before work resumes
4. Implements controls
5. HSR consulted and agrees controls adequate
6. Work resumes

**Outcome:** Serious injury or fatality prevented. HSR exercised right to direct cessation. PCBU cooperated. Issue resolved before resuming work.
