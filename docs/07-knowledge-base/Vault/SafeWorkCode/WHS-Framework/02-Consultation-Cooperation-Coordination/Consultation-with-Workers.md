# Consultation with Workers

## Legal Duty to Consult

Under section 47 of the WHS Act, a PCBU must consult, **so far as is reasonably practicable**, with workers who:
- Carry out work for the business or undertaking, and
- Are (or are likely to be) **directly affected** by a health and safety matter

## Who Must Be Consulted?

The broad definition of "worker" means PCBUs must consult with:
- **Employees** (permanent, part-time, casual)
- **Contractors and subcontractors**
- **Labour hire workers**
- **Apprentices and trainees**
- **Work experience students**
- **Volunteers**
- **Anyone else** carrying out work for the PCBU

**Construction Example:**
A principal contractor must consult with:
- Its own employees (project managers, supervisors, labourers)
- Subcontractors and their workers (electricians, plumbers, carpenters)
- Labour hire workers supplied to the site
- Apprentices working on site
- Anyone else working on the project who is affected by health and safety matters

## When Consultation is Required

PCBUs must consult when:

### 1. Identifying Hazards and Assessing Risks
Workers' experience helps identify hazards that may not be obvious from documentation or external observation.

**Construction Example:**
Before excavation work, consult with excavator operators and workers about:
- Underground services they've encountered on previous projects
- Soil conditions and stability concerns
- Access and egress challenges
- Proximity to existing structures

### 2. Making Decisions About Control Measures
Workers can suggest practical controls and identify barriers to implementation.

**Construction Example:**
When planning fall protection for roof work, consult workers about:
- Which systems work best for the specific roof design
- Anchor point locations that allow practical work
- PPE that provides protection without preventing work tasks
- Sequence of work to minimize time at heights

### 3. Deciding on Adequacy of Welfare Facilities
Consider workers' needs for toilets, drinking water, washing facilities, eating areas, change rooms, and first aid.

**Construction Example:**
Consult about:
- Number and location of toilets for workforce size
- Drinking water access in hot weather
- Shelter for meal breaks
- First aid facilities and trained personnel
- Storage for workers' belongings

### 4. Proposing Changes Affecting Health and Safety
Any change to work processes, equipment, or workplace may affect health and safety.

**Construction Example - Equipment Change:**
Before introducing new concrete cutting equipment:
- Consult about training needs
- Discuss dust control systems
- Identify any concerns about noise or vibration
- Plan for safe storage and maintenance

### 5. Developing Consultation Procedures
Workers should have input into how consultation occurs.

**Construction Example:**
Consult about:
- Best time for toolbox talks (start of shift, after breaks)
- Frequency of site safety meetings
- Process for raising safety concerns
- Whether to elect Health and Safety Representatives

### 6. Resolving Health and Safety Issues
When issues arise, consult to find effective solutions.

**Construction Example - Noise Issue:**
Workers report excessive noise from cutting operations:
- Consult about source and timing of noise
- Discuss potential controls (schedule, barriers, equipment changes)
- Seek workers' ideas for practical solutions
- Agree on controls to implement

### 7. Monitoring Health and Workplace Conditions
When monitoring is required (air quality, noise, health surveillance), consult about:
- What will be monitored and why
- How monitoring will be conducted
- Who will see the results
- What actions will follow from results

### 8. Providing Information and Training
Consult to ensure information and training meet workers' needs and address actual hazards.

**Construction Example:**
Before formwork training:
- Ask workers about previous experience
- Identify knowledge gaps
- Discuss specific systems to be used on project
- Ensure training addresses actual site conditions

## What Effective Consultation Looks Like

See [[Effective-Consultation-Elements|Elements of Effective Consultation]] for detailed guidance.

**The four essential elements:**
1. **Share information** - Both ways between PCBU and workers
2. **Provide reasonable opportunity** - Time and forums for workers to express views
3. **Take views into account** - Genuinely consider workers' input
4. **Advise outcomes** - Tell workers what was decided and why

## Methods of Consultation

See [[Consultation-Methods|Consultation Methods]] for detailed approaches.

**Common methods:**
- **Toolbox talks** - Daily or regular discussions before work
- **Safety meetings** - Scheduled meetings to discuss WHS matters
- **Workplace inspections** - Walk-throughs with worker participation
- **Health and Safety Representatives** - Elected worker representatives
- **WHS Committees** - Formal committees with worker and management representatives
- **Suggestion schemes** - Systems for workers to submit ideas
- **One-on-one discussions** - Individual conversations with supervisors

## Right to Representation

Workers are entitled to:
- Participate directly in consultation, or
- Be represented by a **Health and Safety Representative (HSR)** elected to represent their work group

PCBUs must consult with HSRs on behalf of workers they represent.

**Construction Example:**
Workers on a large construction site elect HSRs for each trade or area:
- Formwork and concrete HSR
- Steel fixing HSR
- Scaffolding HSR
- General construction HSR

Principal contractor consults with these HSRs on matters affecting their respective work groups.

## Timing of Consultation

Consultation must occur **early enough** to genuinely influence decisions.

> [!warning] Consultation is Not Notification
> Telling workers about a decision already made is not consultation. Workers must have opportunity to provide input before decisions are finalized.

**Construction Example - Poor Consultation:**
❌ "We've decided to use System A scaffolding. Here's how it works." (This is notification, not consultation)

**Construction Example - Proper Consultation:**
✓ "We're planning scaffolding for the project. What are your experiences with different scaffold systems? What works well? What should we avoid?" (This allows genuine input before decisions are made)

## Language and Communication

Information must be provided in a way workers can understand:
- Use plain language, not technical jargon (unless workers are familiar with technical terms)
- Provide information in languages workers speak
- Use visual aids, diagrams, and demonstrations where helpful
- Check understanding, don't just assume workers understand

**Construction Example - Multilingual Workforce:**
On a site with workers speaking English, Mandarin, and Arabic:
- Provide toolbox talk content in all three languages
- Use visual diagrams showing hazards and controls
- Have multilingual supervisors or interpreters available
- Confirm understanding by asking workers to explain back

## Barriers to Effective Consultation

Common barriers include:

**Time pressure:**
- "We don't have time to consult, work must start now"
- **Solution:** Build consultation time into project planning; early consultation saves time later

**Language differences:**
- Workers don't understand English-only information
- **Solution:** Provide multilingual materials and interpreters

**Fear of reprisal:**
- Workers afraid to speak up about concerns
- **Solution:** Create safe environment; act on concerns raised; never punish workers for raising safety issues

**Hierarchical culture:**
- Workers defer to management and don't challenge decisions
- **Solution:** Actively seek workers' input; demonstrate that input influences decisions; recognize and act on suggestions

**Shift work or dispersed workforce:**
- Hard to get everyone together
- **Solution:** Multiple consultation sessions; use technology (video calls, messaging); consult HSRs representing work groups

## Documentation

While not always legally required, documenting consultation demonstrates compliance and creates accountability.

**Consider documenting:**
- Date and participants in consultation
- Matter discussed
- Views expressed by workers
- Decisions made
- Rationale for decisions
- Actions arising and responsibilities

**Construction Example - Toolbox Talk Record:**
```
Date: [Date]
Project: [Project name]
Attendees: [Names or number of workers]
Topics discussed:
- Excavation work commencing tomorrow
- Underground services located and marked
- Shoring system to be installed
Worker input:
- Concerns about water table in wet weather
- Request for additional lighting in excavation
- Suggestion to install ladder access at north end
Decisions:
- Dewatering pump to be on standby
- Lighting to be installed before entry
- Ladder access to be installed as suggested
Actions:
- [Name] to arrange pump (by tomorrow 7am)
- [Name] to install lighting (today)
- [Name] to modify shoring plan for ladder access
```
