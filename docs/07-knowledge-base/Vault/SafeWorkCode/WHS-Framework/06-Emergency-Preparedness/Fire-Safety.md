# Fire Safety on Construction Sites

## Fire Risk in Construction

Construction sites present significant fire risks due to:
- **Hot work** (welding, cutting, grinding)
- **Flammable and combustible materials** (timber, formwork oil, solvents, LPG, acetylene)
- **Ignition sources** (temporary electrical, power tools, smoking)
- **Combustible waste** accumulation (packaging, off-cuts, sawdust)
- **Incomplete fire protection systems** (building under construction)

> [!warning] Critical Fire Risks
> Construction sites are particularly vulnerable because:
> - Fire detection/suppression systems not yet operational
> - Multiple ignition sources present
> - Large quantities of combustible materials
> - Hot work occurring throughout site
> - Escape routes may be incomplete

**Reference:** [Code of Practice: Construction work](../../code%20of%20practice/construction_work.md)

## Fire Prevention

### Control Combustible Materials

**Minimize accumulation:**
- Keep only **lowest quantity** of combustible/flammable materials needed on site
- Daily cleanup of combustible waste (off-cuts, packaging, sawdust)
- Designated storage areas away from ignition sources
- Clear exit and escape routes
- Adequate rubbish bins and recycling bins

**Separate incompatible materials:**
- Flammable liquids (solvent, petrol) stored separately from oxidizers (oxygen cylinders)
- LPG and acetylene cylinders stored in separate, well-ventilated areas
- Distance from hot work areas

> [!example] Construction Site Housekeeping
> Large commercial construction site implements daily cleanup requirement:
> - Each trade cleans own work area at end of shift
> - Timber off-cuts placed in designated bin (emptied daily)
> - Cardboard/packaging collected to skip bin
> - Sawdust vacuumed from carpentry area
> - Flammable substances returned to external storage cage
> - Result: Combustible load minimized, fire risk reduced

---

### Safe Storage of Flammable/Combustible Substances

**Flammable liquids (petrol, solvents, thinners, formwork oil):**
- External storage in ventilated, fire-rated cabinet or cage
- Away from ignition sources, buildings, boundaries
- Grounded containers to prevent static ignition
