# Emergency Planning and Procedures

## Overview

Every construction workplace must have an emergency plan that prepares workers and others to respond effectively to emergencies. Effective emergency planning saves lives by ensuring people know what to do when seconds count.

> [!important] Legal Requirement
> WHS Regulation 43 requires PCBUs to have an emergency plan if an emergency could occur at the workplace. The plan must provide procedures for emergency evacuation, medical treatment, rescue, effective communication, and testing the emergency procedures.

## When an Emergency Plan Is Required

An emergency plan is required if there is a possibility that an emergency could occur at the workplace that requires immediate evacuation, rescue, or medical treatment.

**Construction Site Emergencies Include:**

- Fire or explosion
- Structural collapse or failure
- Person fallen from height
- Person injured by mobile plant
- Entrapment in confined space or excavation
- Electrocution
- Exposure to hazardous substances
- Medical emergency (heart attack, heat stroke, allergic reaction)
- Natural disasters (flood, severe storm, bushfire)
- Security threats or violence

Given the range of potential emergencies on construction sites, all construction workplaces require an emergency plan.

## What the Emergency Plan Must Include

### 1. Emergency Evacuation Procedures

**Assembly Points:**
Designate assembly points:
- Located outside the danger area but easily accessible from all work zones
- Away from vehicle routes and crane operating areas
- Protected from falling debris and hazardous atmospheres
- Clearly marked with signs visible from multiple directions

On large or multi-level sites, establish multiple assembly points for different zones.

**Evacuation Routes:**
Identify primary and alternative evacuation routes:
- Wide enough for rapid movement of all site personnel
- Free from obstructions and trip hazards
- Illuminated for night work
- Accessible to persons with disabilities
- Posted on site maps at key locations

**Evacuation Signals:**
Establish distinctive emergency signals:
- Air horn, siren, or verbal "evacuate" instruction via radio/PA
- Different signals for different emergency types if required
- Audible throughout the entire site including noisy work areas
- Tested regularly to ensure recognition

**Evacuation Process:**
1. Emergency discovered—person raises alarm immediately
2. Site supervisor/principal contractor confirms emergency and orders evacuation
3. Emergency signal activated
4. All persons stop work and evacuate via designated routes to assembly points
5. Supervisors/leading hands account for all persons in their crew
6. Site supervisor confirms all persons accounted for
7. Emergency services contacted and briefed
8. No re-entry until site supervisor declares safe

> [!example] Construction Site Evacuation
> At a six-story commercial building construction site, a scaffold collapse injures multiple workers on level 3. The site supervisor activates the air horn evacuation signal. Workers from all levels evacuate via stairwells to the ground level assembly point behind the site office, away from the collapsed scaffold. Leading hands account for their crews using the site attendance register. Once all workers are accounted for, the site supervisor confirms the incident location and number of injured to emergency services.

### 2. Medical Treatment and First Aid Procedures

**Calling for Help:**
Document the process for summoning medical assistance:
- **Emergency services:** Dial 000 (Triple Zero)
- **Information to provide:** Location (site address, nearest cross street), nature of injury, number of injured, access instructions for ambulances
- **Who calls:** Site supervisor or delegated person (identify by name/role)
- **Site contact:** Designated person meets ambulance at site entrance to guide emergency responders

**First Aid Response:**
- Identify trained first aiders and how to locate them (radio call, runner, visible vest)
- Location of first aid kits and equipment
- Procedures for moving injured persons (only when essential for safety or first aid)
- Communication method for summoning first aider to incident location

**Serious Injuries:**
If a person is seriously injured, killed, or a dangerous incident occurs:
- Preserve the incident scene (unless doing so poses further risk)
- Notify SafeWork NSW immediately (13 10 50)
- Do not disturb the scene until an inspector authorizes
- Provide support to affected workers

### 3. Rescue Procedures

**When Rescue Is Required:**

Construction sites involve work where persons may require rescue:
- Falls arrested by harnesses at height
- Entrapment in confined spaces
- Entrapment in trenches or excavations
- Contact with live electrical apparatus
- Immersion in water

**Rescue Planning:**

For each activity where rescue may be needed, document:

**Equipment Required:**
- Rescue harnesses, tripods, winches for confined space rescue
- Rescue kits for persons suspended in fall arrest harnesses
- Rope rescue equipment for heights
- Shoring and bracing for trench rescue
- Insulating equipment for electrical rescue

**Trained Personnel:**
- Who is trained in rescue procedures for each scenario?
- How are they summoned?
- Are sufficient trained rescuers available on every shift?

**Rescue Method:**
Step-by-step procedures for performing rescue safely, considering:
- How to access the person in distress
- How to extricate without further injury
- Additional hazards rescuers may face (hazardous atmosphere, fall risk, electrical contact)
- When to wait for emergency services rather than attempt immediate rescue

**Communication:**
- How the need for rescue is communicated
- How rescuers communicate with each other
- How emergency services are briefed

> [!warning] Confined Space Rescue
> Confined space rescue is complex and high-risk. Rescuers must:
> - Use appropriate PPE and breathing apparatus
> - Monitor atmosphere continuously
> - Maintain contact with persons outside the space
> - Never enter without proper training and equipment
> 
> Untrained rescue attempts in confined spaces frequently result in multiple fatalities. Plan for professional emergency services rescue for complex confined space scenarios.

### 4. Effective Communication

**Emergency Contacts:**

Maintain up-to-date emergency contact information:
- Emergency services: 000
- SafeWork NSW: 13 10 50
- Site supervisor and principal contractor (mobile numbers)
- Site safety officer
- Medical facilities (nearest hospital emergency department)
- Utility providers (electricity, gas) for emergency disconnection
- Specialist rescue services if required

Display emergency contacts prominently:
- Site office
- Site entry point
- Assembly points
- Break facilities

**Internal Communication:**

Specify how information is communicated during emergencies:
- **Radio channels:** Designated emergency channel, call signs
- **Mobile phones:** Key personnel phone list
- **Visual signals:** Hand signals if radio communication fails
- **Runners:** Physical messengers if electronic communication fails

**External Communication:**

Designate who communicates with:
- Emergency services
- SafeWork NSW
- Client/building owner
- Neighboring properties if evacuation required
- Media (if applicable)

### 5. Testing Emergency Procedures

**Regular Drills:**

Emergency procedures must be tested through regular drills to ensure:
- Workers recognize emergency signals
- Evacuation routes are clear and effective
- Assembly points are appropriate
- Headcounts can be completed quickly
- First aiders and rescue personnel can respond effectively

**Frequency:**
- New sites: Within first week of site establishment
- Ongoing sites: Minimum quarterly, or when significant site changes occur
- After major workforce changes (multiple new subcontractors)

**Drill Process:**
1. Plan the drill (notify key personnel, select scenario)
2. Activate emergency signal without prior warning to general workforce
3. Observe evacuation process (timing, route usage, problems encountered)
4. Conduct headcount at assembly points
5. Debrief participants—what worked, what didn't?
6. Record outcomes and implement improvements
7. Communicate lessons learned to all workers

> [!tip] Realistic Scenarios
> Vary drill scenarios to test different emergency types (fire on level 3, person fallen in excavation, hazardous substance spill). This prevents workers from becoming complacent about evacuation routes and procedures.

## Developing the Emergency Plan

### Step 1: Identify Potential Emergencies

Consider all reasonably foreseeable emergencies for your site:
- What activities are being performed? (working at heights, confined spaces, electrical work, hot work)
- What hazardous substances are on site? (fuels, LPG, chemicals)
- What could go wrong? (fire, explosion, collapse, falls, entrapment)
- What environmental hazards exist? (flood risk, bushfire proximity, severe weather)

### Step 2: Assess Emergency Risks

For each potential emergency, assess:
- How likely is this emergency?
- How many people could be affected?
- How quickly would the emergency escalate?
- Can people evacuate easily, or could they be trapped?
- What injuries or harm could result?

Higher-risk emergencies require more detailed planning and resources.

### Step 3: Plan Emergency Responses

For each identified emergency, document:
- How the emergency is detected and alarm raised
- Immediate actions to reduce harm (isolate energy sources, activate suppression systems)
- Evacuation or shelter-in-place decision
- Rescue requirements if persons are trapped or injured
- Medical response
- How emergency services are summoned and guided to the incident
- How workers are accounted for

### Step 4: Identify Required Resources

Determine what is needed to implement the plan:

**Equipment:**
- Emergency signaling devices (air horn, PA system)
- First aid kits and equipment
- Rescue equipment (for heights, confined spaces, trenches)
- Fire extinguishers and fire blankets
- Emergency lighting for evacuation routes
- Spill kits for hazardous substances

**Personnel:**
- First aiders (minimum number based on site size and risk)
- Trained rescue personnel
- Fire wardens (if required)
- Person responsible for activating emergency response
- Person responsible for contacting emergency services

**Information:**
- Emergency contact numbers
- Site maps showing assembly points and evacuation routes
- Utility isolation points (electricity, gas, water)
- Hazardous substance registers and SDS

### Step 5: Document and Communicate

Create a written emergency plan that is:
- **Clear and concise:** Written in plain language
- **Accessible:** Posted at site entry, office, assembly points, break areas
- **Communicated:** Covered in site induction for all workers
- **Readily available:** Kept in site office, supervisor vehicles

Include site maps showing:
- Assembly points
- Evacuation routes
- First aid stations
- Fire extinguisher locations
- Emergency equipment storage
- Utility isolation points

### Step 6: Train Workers

Ensure all workers understand emergency procedures:

**Site Induction:**
- Emergency signals and what they mean
- Evacuation routes and assembly points for their work area
- Location of first aid facilities and who are the first aiders
- How to report emergencies
- Who is responsible for emergency coordination

**Specific Role Training:**
- First aiders: Current first aid certification
- Rescue personnel: Training in specific rescue scenarios (heights, confined space, trench)
- Fire wardens: Fire extinguisher use, evacuation coordination

**Refresher Training:**
After emergency drills, review lessons learned and update procedures.

### Step 7: Test and Review

Test the plan through:
- **Tabletop exercises:** Discuss emergency scenarios with supervisors and key personnel
- **Evacuation drills:** Practice full-site evacuations
- **Equipment tests:** Test emergency alarms, check rescue equipment functionality

Review the plan:
- After each drill or actual emergency
- When site layout, activities, or personnel change significantly
- Minimum annually
- When incidents reveal plan deficiencies

## Summary

An effective emergency plan:

1. **Identifies** all reasonably foreseeable emergencies
2. **Provides procedures** for evacuation, medical response, rescue, and communication
3. **Assigns responsibilities** for emergency coordination and response
4. **Ensures resources** are available (equipment, trained personnel)
5. **Is communicated** to all workers through induction and training
6. **Is tested regularly** through drills and exercises
7. **Is reviewed and updated** when circumstances change or deficiencies are identified

Emergency planning is a critical component of construction site safety. Preparing for emergencies ensures that when incidents occur, workers know what to do, lives are saved, and harm is minimized.
