# Emergency Preparedness Overview

## Legal Requirement

PCBUs must ensure, so far as is reasonably practicable, the provision of:
- **Emergency plans** and procedures
- **Adequate first aid** facilities and trained personnel
- **Emergency equipment** (fire extinguishers, emergency lighting, etc.)
- **Access to emergency services**

## What is an Emergency?

An emergency is an event that:
- Requires immediate action
- Threatens the safety of people at the workplace
- Could result in serious injury or death

### Construction Emergencies

Common construction emergencies include:
- **Fire or explosion**
- **Structural collapse** (scaffolding, formwork, excavation)
- **Person trapped** (in excavation, confined space, machinery)
- **Falls from heights** with serious injury
- **Electrocution**
- **Gas leaks** or hazardous substance releases
- **Medical emergencies** (heart attack, heat stroke, serious injury)
- **Natural disasters** (storms, floods, earthquakes)

## Emergency Planning

### Emergency Plan Requirements

Emergency plans must:
- Identify foreseeable emergencies
- Establish emergency procedures for each type of emergency
- Specify evacuation procedures
- Identify locations of emergency equipment
- Nominate emergency contact persons
- Detail testing and review procedures

### Construction Site Emergency Plans

Consider:
- **Site-specific hazards** (heights, excavations, confined spaces, chemicals)
- **Changing site conditions** as construction progresses
- **Multiple PCBUs** and coordination of emergency response
- **Access for emergency services** (ambulances, fire trucks)
- **Communication systems** (how to raise alarm, contact emergency services)
- **Assembly points** away from hazards
- **Visitor and contractor management** during emergencies

## Emergency Procedures

### Evacuation Procedures

**Must specify:**
- **When to evacuate** (alarm signals, who can authorize)
- **How to evacuate** (evacuation routes, assembly points)
- **Who ensures everyone evacuated** (floor/area wardens)
- **How to account for people** (roll calls, visitor sign-in sheets)
- **When workers can re-enter** (all-clear procedures)

**Construction considerations:**
- Evacuation from heights (scaffolding, elevated floors)
- Accounting for workers in excavations or confined spaces
- Multiple assembly points for large sites
- Audible alarms over construction noise
- Multilingual workforce understanding procedures

### Fire Emergency Procedures

- **Raise the alarm** - alert others to danger
- **Call emergency services** - 000 or site emergency number
- **Attempt to extinguish** - only if safe to do so with appropriate extinguisher
- **Evacuate if fire cannot be controlled** - close doors to contain fire
- **Account for all persons** at assembly point

> [!warning] Do Not Risk Your Life Fighting Fire
> Only attempt to extinguish small fires if you are trained, have appropriate equipment, and have a clear escape route.

### Confined Space Rescue

Confined spaces require **specific rescue plans** before entry:
- Trained rescue team or emergency services on standby
- Rescue equipment (harnesses, winches, breathing apparatus)
- Communication system between entry team and standby
- Never enter a confined space to attempt rescue without training and equipment

### Person Trapped or Seriously Injured

- **Call 000 immediately** - request ambulance and describe situation
- **Provide first aid** if trained and safe to do so
- **DO NOT move injured person** unless immediate danger (fire, collapse)
- **Preserve the scene** for investigation (where safe to do so)
- **Notify SafeWork NSW** - serious injuries and dangerous incidents are notifiable

## Emergency Equipment

### Fire Fighting Equipment

**Portable fire extinguishers:**
- Appropriate type for fire risks (Class A, B, C, E, F)
- Located near fire risks
- Accessible and clearly signposted
- Tested and maintained regularly

**Construction sites typically need:**
- Dry chemical powder extinguishers (multi-purpose)
- CO2 extinguishers near electrical equipment
- Fire blankets in site offices and meal areas

**Other fire equipment:**
- Fire hoses and hydrants (permanent buildings)
- Fire blankets
- Sprinkler systems (if installed)

### Emergency Lighting

Required where:
- Workers need to evacuate in darkness or smoke
- Power failure could trap workers
- Evacuation routes not adequately lit

**Construction considerations:**
- Emergency lighting in enclosed areas
- Torches or headlamps for confined spaces
- Backup power for construction sites

### Emergency Communication

Essential systems:
- **Alarm systems** - to alert workers to evacuate
- **Two-way radios** - for communication during emergencies
- **Mobile phones** - to call emergency services
- **Emergency contact lists** - displayed prominently

### First Aid Equipment

See [[First-Aid|First Aid]] section for detailed requirements.

**Minimum requirements:**
- First aid kits appropriate to workplace size and hazards
- Located where readily accessible
- Maintained and stocked

## First Aid Provision

### First Aid Requirements

PCBUs must provide:
- **Adequate first aid facilities** (first aid kits, rooms)
- **First aid trained personnel** (sufficient number for workplace)
- **Access to medical services** (arrangements for transport to medical treatment)

### How Many First Aiders?

Consider:
- Number of workers
- Nature of work and level of risk
- Location and access to medical services
- Work arrangements (shifts, scattered locations)

**Construction guideline:**
- **Low-risk sites:** 1 first aider per 50 workers
- **High-risk sites:** 1 first aider per 25 workers
- **Remote sites:** Higher ratio and advanced first aid training

### First Aid Training

**Recommended training:**
- **Provide First Aid** (HLTAID011) - standard first aid
- **Remote or High-Risk:** Advanced first aid and CPR
- **Refresher training** - every 3 years (CPR annually)

### First Aid Facilities

**Construction sites need:**
- **First aid room** - for large or long-term projects
- **First aid kits** - in site offices, on vehicles, with mobile crews
- **Equipment** - stretchers, spinal boards, eye wash stations
- **Clean water** - for washing wounds and eye injuries

## Emergency Training and Drills

### Training Requirements

Workers must be informed about:
- Emergency procedures for the workplace
- Location of emergency equipment
- Location of emergency exits and assembly points
- How to raise the alarm
- Their roles in emergencies (wardens, first aiders)

**Training should be:**
- Part of site induction for new workers
- Refreshed regularly
- Provided in languages workers understand
- Practical (demonstrate using extinguishers, evacuation routes)

### Emergency Drills

Conduct drills to:
- Test emergency procedures
- Practice evacuation
- Identify problems with procedures
- Train workers in their emergency roles
- Build confidence in emergency response

**Construction site drills:**
- Schedule during toolbox talks or site meetings
- Practice evacuating from different areas of site
- Test alarm systems
- Time evacuation and account for all persons
- Review and improve procedures after each drill

## Notifiable Incidents

Certain emergencies must be **notified immediately** to SafeWork NSW:

### Notifiable Incidents Include

- **Death** of a person
- **Serious injury or illness:**
  - Requires immediate treatment as in-patient in hospital
  - Immediate treatment for serious head, eye, chest, or abdominal injury
