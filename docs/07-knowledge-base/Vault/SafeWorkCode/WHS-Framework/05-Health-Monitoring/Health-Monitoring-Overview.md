# Health Monitoring Overview

## What is Health Monitoring?

Health monitoring (also called health surveillance) is the monitoring of a person to identify changes in their health status because of exposure to certain hazardous substances or work activities.

> [!important] Legal Requirement
> Health monitoring is **mandatory** when required by WHS Regulations, usually involving exposure to specific hazardous substances.

## When Health Monitoring is Required

Health monitoring is required when:
- A worker is carrying out ongoing work involving specific hazardous substances
- Exposure may result in identifiable disease or health effect
- There is a valid technique for detecting the disease or effect
- The technique has minimal risk to the worker

### Substances Requiring Health Monitoring

**Construction-relevant substances include:**
- **Asbestos** - for workers removing asbestos or exposed to airborne asbestos
- **Lead** - for workers exposed to lead above action levels
- **Crystalline silica** - for workers at risk of exposure to respirable crystalline silica
- **Isocyanates** - in paints, adhesives, and foam products
- **Organophosphates and carbamates** - in some pesticides

See WHS Regulations Schedule 14 for the complete list.

## Purpose of Health Monitoring

Health monitoring:
- **Detects early signs** of work-related ill health
- **Identifies inadequate controls** allowing excessive exposure
- **Verifies control effectiveness** by showing no adverse health effects
- **Provides early intervention** before serious disease develops
- **Informs risk assessment** and control measures

> [!note] Health Monitoring vs Health Surveillance
> "Health monitoring" and "health surveillance" are often used interchangeably. Both refer to medical monitoring required by regulations.

## What Health Monitoring Involves

Depending on the substance, monitoring may include:
- **Medical history and examination** by a registered medical practitioner
- **Biological monitoring** - testing blood, urine, or breath for substance levels
- **Lung function tests** - for respiratory hazards like silica and asbestos
- **Hearing tests** - for noise exposure (audiometry)
- **Skin examinations** - for dermatological hazards
- **Chest X-rays** - for lung diseases (silicosis, asbestosis)

## PCBU Responsibilities

### Arrange Health Monitoring

PCBUs must arrange health monitoring when required by regulations:
- Identify which workers require health monitoring
- Engage a registered medical practitioner experienced in health monitoring
- Ensure monitoring occurs at required frequencies
- Pay all costs of health monitoring

### Inform Workers

Before health monitoring:
- Explain why monitoring is required
- Describe what monitoring will involve
- Inform worker of their right to receive results
- Explain confidentiality of health information

### Provide Information to Medical Practitioner

Provide the doctor with:
- Nature of the work
- Substances the worker is exposed to
- Extent and duration of exposure
- Control measures in place
- Previous health monitoring results (if available)

### Respond to Results

If monitoring indicates adverse health effects:
- Review and improve control measures
- Reduce worker's exposure
- Consider modifying work duties if recommended
- Provide rehabilitation if needed
- Report to regulator if required

### Keep Records

Maintain records of:
- Names of workers monitored
- Dates of health monitoring
- Health monitoring reports (kept confidentially)

Records must be kept for 30 years or longer for certain substances.

## Worker Rights and Responsibilities

### Workers Must

- Participate in health monitoring when required
- Provide accurate health history to medical practitioner
- Attend monitoring appointments arranged by PCBU

### Workers Have Right To

- Receive a copy of their health monitoring results
- Understand what results mean
- Privacy and confidentiality of health information
- Not have health monitoring results used for discrimination

> [!important] Confidentiality
> Health monitoring results are confidential medical information. PCBUs only receive information necessary to manage workplace risks, not detailed medical information.

## Frequency of Health Monitoring

Frequency depends on the substance and level of exposure:

**Initial (baseline) monitoring:**
- Before or within period of commencing exposure work

**Periodic monitoring:**
- During ongoing exposure work
- Frequency varies by substance (annually, every 2 years, etc.)

**Exit monitoring:**
- When worker ceases exposure work
- Particularly important for substances with long latency diseases (asbestos)

**Example - Silica Exposure:**
- Baseline: Before or within 6 weeks of starting silica exposure work
- Periodic: Every 2 years during ongoing exposure
- Exit: When ceasing silica exposure work

## Health Monitoring Reports

The medical practitioner provides:

**To the worker:**
- Full health monitoring report including test results and findings

**To the PCBU:**
- Certificate stating whether monitoring identified evidence of disease or effect
- Recommendations for adjusting work practices or controls
- Whether worker is medically fit to continue the work
- NO detailed medical information or diagnosis

## Acting on Health Monitoring Results

If monitoring identifies adverse health effects:

### Immediate Actions

- Remove worker from exposure or reduce exposure
- Review control measures for adequacy
- Consider if other workers are also affected
- Seek medical advice on fitness for work

### Investigation

- Investigate why controls failed to prevent exposure
- Assess whether monitoring should be extended to other workers
- Review risk assessment for the substance

### Improvements

- Implement improved control measures
- Monitor effectiveness of new controls
- Increase frequency of health monitoring if needed
- Provide additional training on controls

### Reporting

- Notify SafeWork NSW if required
- Notify workers' compensation insurer if work-related injury/disease
- Update health and safety records

## Construction Example: Silica Dust

**Scenario:** Workers cutting, grinding, or drilling concrete, masonry, or stone

### When Health Monitoring Required

Workers at risk of exposure to respirable crystalline silica dust.

### What is Monitored

- **Baseline:** Medical history, chest X-ray, lung function test
- **Periodic (every 2 years):** Medical examination, lung function test, chest X-ray (if indicated)
- **Exit:** Medical examination and tests as indicated

### PCBU Actions

1. **Identify workers** - Those using power tools on concrete, stone, masonry
2. **Engage medical practitioner** - Experienced in occupational health
3. **Provide information** - Types of work, duration, control measures in place
4. **Arrange monitoring** - Before work starts, then every 2 years
5. **Receive reports** - Certificates indicating fitness for work
6. **Review controls** - If monitoring indicates exposure occurring

### If Silicosis Detected

- Immediately review and improve dust controls
- Remove worker from further silica exposure
- Arrange specialist medical treatment
- Investigate controls failure
- Assess other workers' exposures
- Report to SafeWork NSW (notifiable disease)
