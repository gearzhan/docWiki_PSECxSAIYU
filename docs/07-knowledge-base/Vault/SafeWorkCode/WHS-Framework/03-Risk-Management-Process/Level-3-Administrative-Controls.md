# Level 3: Administrative Controls

## Rely on Procedures and Behavior

Administrative controls use procedures, training, and work practices to reduce risk exposure.

> [!warning] Least Reliable Alone
> Administrative controls depend on human behavior and consistent application. Should never be sole control where higher-level controls reasonably practicable.

## Types of Administrative Controls

### Safe Work Procedures

**Written procedures describing safe work methods:**
- Step-by-step instructions
- Hazards and controls for each step
- Safe Work Method Statements ([[SWMS|SWMS]]) for high-risk construction work

**Effectiveness requires:**
- Procedures developed with worker input
- Training in procedures
- Readily accessible
- Actually followed

### Permits to Work

**Formal authorization for high-risk activities:**
- Hot work permits (welding, cutting, grinding)
- Confined space entry permits
- Electrical work permits
- Roof access permits

**Purpose:**
- Ensures controls in place before work starts
- Documented authorization and checks
- Clear responsibility

### Training and Competency

**Ensure workers have knowledge and skills:**
- WHS induction (general construction, site-specific)
- Task-specific training
- Equipment operation training
- High-risk work licenses

**Construction Examples:**
- White Card (general construction induction)
- Scaffolding licenses
- Forklift licenses
- Confined space training

### Supervision

**Competent oversight of work:**
- Ensures procedures followed
- Identifies and corrects unsafe practices
- Provides guidance to inexperienced workers
- Particularly important for high-risk work

### Signage and Warnings

**Visual communication of hazards:**
- Warning signs (hazard present)
- Prohibition signs (action not allowed)
- Mandatory signs (action required)
- Emergency information signs

**Examples:**
- "DANGER - ASBESTOS"
- "NO ENTRY - AUTHORIZED PERSONNEL ONLY"
- "HARD HAT AREA"
- Emergency assembly point signs

### Job Rotation and Rest Breaks

**Reduce exposure duration:**
- Rotate workers between tasks (reduces repetitive strain, noise exposure)
- Regular breaks from physically/mentally demanding work
- Limit time in extreme temperatures
- Reduce continuous exposure to hazardous substances

### Housekeeping

**Maintain clean, organized workplace:**
- Regular cleanup prevents slip/trip hazards
- Remove combustibles (fire prevention)
- Organized storage reduces manual handling
- Clear access/egress routes

### Scheduling and Planning

**Organize work to reduce risks:**
- Schedule noisy work when fewer workers present
- Plan deliveries to minimize manual handling
- Coordinate activities to avoid conflicts
- Weather restrictions (no roof work in high wind/rain)

## Limitations

**Why administrative controls least effective:**

**Rely on humans:**
- People forget
- Take shortcuts under time pressure
- May not understand importance

**Can fail invisibly:**
- Procedure not followed, but work appears normal
- Problem only discovered when incident occurs

**Require constant vigilance:**
- Ongoing supervision and monitoring needed
- Training must be refreshed
- Procedures must be updated

## When Administrative Controls Appropriate

**As supplement to higher controls:**
- SWMS for work with engineering controls in place
- Training in use of engineering controls and PPE
- Permits ensuring checks completed before high-risk work

**For residual risks:**
- Risks remaining after engineering controls
- Low-probability risks where engineering controls not practicable

**For organizational systems:**
- Incident reporting and investigation
- Inspection and maintenance schedules
- Consultation processes

## Practical Examples

### SWMS for Roof Work

**Higher controls:**
- Edge protection (engineering/isolation)
- Fall arrest anchor points (engineering)

**Administrative controls:**
- SWMS documenting work method, hazards, controls
- Training in fall arrest equipment use
- Weather restrictions (no work if rain/wind)
- Competent supervision
- Pre-start inspections

### Hot Work Permit

**Higher controls:**
- Flammable materials removed from area (elimination)
- Fire extinguishers available (engineering)

**Administrative controls:**
- Permit system ensures checks completed
- Fire watch during and after work
- Authorization by competent person

### Traffic Management

**Higher controls:**
- Physical separation of pedestrians and vehicles (isolation)
- Barriers/fencing (engineering)

**Administrative controls:**
- Traffic management plan
- Speed limits
- Exclusion zones enforced
- Induction training on site traffic rules
- High-visibility clothing
