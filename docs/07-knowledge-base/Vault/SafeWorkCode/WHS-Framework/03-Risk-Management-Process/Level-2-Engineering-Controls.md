# Level 2: Engineering Controls

## Control Hazard Through Physical Means

Engineering controls use physical modifications or equipment to reduce exposure to hazards.

## Common Engineering Controls

### Ventilation Systems

**Local Exhaust Ventilation (LEV):**
- Captures contaminants at source before dispersion
- Welding fume extraction hoods
- Dust collection on power tools
- Chemical fume cupboards

**General Ventilation:**
- Dilutes airborne contaminants
- Fresh air supply to work areas
- May use natural or mechanical ventilation

**Construction Examples:**
- On-tool dust extraction for concrete cutting/grinding
- Portable ventilation fans in enclosed spaces
- LEV for spray painting booths

### Guarding

**Fixed Guards:**
- Permanent barriers over dangerous parts
- Circular saw blade guards
- Machine drive belt guards

**Interlocked Guards:**
- Machine stops when guard opened
- Common on industrial machinery

**Adjustable Guards:**
- Can be positioned for different operations
- Table saw riving knife

### Dust and Fume Control

**Water Suppression:**
- Wet cutting/grinding (binds silica dust)
- Water sprays on demolition (suppresses dust clouds)
- Wet methods for asbestos work

**Extraction Systems:**
- On-tool vacuum extraction
- HEPA-filtered vacuums for hazardous dust
- Centralized dust collection

### Noise Reduction

**At Source:**
- Mufflers on exhausts
- Damping materials on vibrating surfaces
- Equipment enclosures (acoustic barriers)

**Between Source and Receiver:**
- Noise barriers/screens
- Increasing distance

### Automation and Remote Control

**Remove worker from hazard:**
- Remote-controlled demolition equipment
- Automated material handling
- Robotic systems for hazardous tasks

### Process Modification

**Change how work done:**
- Water suppression for silica dust control
- Enclosed systems for chemical mixing
- Mechanical handling instead of manual

## Practical Examples

**Silica Dust Control:**
- Wet-cutting saw with continuous water feed
- On-tool vacuum extraction
- Combination provides maximum dust suppression

**Fall Protection:**
- Permanent anchor points on roofs
- Edge protection systems
- Safety mesh under fragile surfaces

**Electrical Safety:**
- RCDs (residual current devices) on all portable equipment
- Earth leakage protection

**Plant Safety:**
- Rollover protective structures (ROPS) on excavators
- Proximity detection systems on mobile plant
- Reversing cameras and alarms

## Maintenance Critical

Engineering controls only effective if maintained:
- Regular inspection and testing
- Preventive maintenance schedules
- Repairs when defects identified
- Records of maintenance
