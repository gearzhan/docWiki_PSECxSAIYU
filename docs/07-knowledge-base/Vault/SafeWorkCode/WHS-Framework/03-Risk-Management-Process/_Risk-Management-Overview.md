# Risk Management Process Overview

## The Four-Step Risk Management Process

The WHS Regulations require PCBUs to manage risks using a systematic four-step process:

1. **[[Step-1-Identify-Hazards|Identify Hazards]]** - Find what could cause harm
2. **[[Step-2-Assess-Risks|Assess Risks]]** - Determine likelihood and severity
3. **[[Step-3-Control-Risks|Control Risks]]** - Implement controls following the hierarchy
4. **[[Step-4-Maintain-and-Review|Maintain and Review]]** - Monitor and review control effectiveness

> [!important] Ongoing Process
> Risk management is not a one-time activity. It must be ongoing and reviewed when circumstances change.

> [!tip] Code of Practice Reference
> Safe Work Australia's **[How to manage work health and safety risks](../../code%20of%20practice/manage_work_health_and_safety_risks.md)** provides the foundational guidance for this risk management process. It applies to all industries and forms the basis for the construction-specific guidance in this framework.

## Step 1: Identify Hazards

A **hazard** is anything that has the potential to cause harm (injury, illness, or damage).

### Common Construction Hazards

**Physical hazards:**
- Falls from heights (roofs, scaffolding, ladders, excavations)
- Moving plant and vehicles
- Electricity
- Noise
- Confined spaces

**Chemical hazards:**
- Silica dust from cutting/grinding
- Asbestos in existing structures
- Welding fumes
- Paints, adhesives, solvents

**Manual handling hazards:**
- Lifting heavy materials
- Repetitive tasks
- Awkward postures

**Psychosocial hazards:**
- Work pressure and deadlines
- Bullying and harassment
- Fatigue from long hours

### How to Find Hazards

- **Walk the workplace** and observe work activities
- **Talk to workers** - they know the actual hazards
- **Review records** - incidents, injuries, near-misses
- **Check manufacturer information** - for plant and substances
- **Consult codes of practice** - for known hazards in your industry
- **Monitor** - health surveillance, air monitoring, noise monitoring

See [[Step-1-Identify-Hazards|Step 1: Identify Hazards]] for detailed guidance.

## Step 2: Assess Risks

**Risk** is the possibility that harm might occur when exposed to a hazard.

### Risk Assessment Considers

**Likelihood:** How probable is it that harm will occur?
- Certain/almost certain
- Likely
- Possible
- Unlikely
- Rare

**Severity:** How serious would the harm be?
- Death or permanent disability
- Serious injury requiring hospitalization
- Moderate injury requiring medical treatment
- Minor injury requiring first aid
- Negligible consequences

**Exposure:** How many people? How often? For how long?

### When to Assess Risks

- **Always** identify and assess risks before starting work
- **Higher priority** for high-consequence hazards
- **Detailed assessment** where uncertainty exists about risks
- **Quick assessment** where risks are well-known and controls established

See [[Step-2-Assess-Risks|Step 2: Assess Risks]] for detailed guidance.

## Step 3: Control Risks

After assessing risks, implement controls following the **hierarchy of control**.

### Hierarchy of Control

**Level 1: Elimination (Most Effective)**
- Remove the hazard entirely
- Example: Prefabricate at ground level instead of working at heights

**Level 2: Minimise Risk**
- **Substitution** - Replace with something less hazardous
  - Example: Use water-based paint instead of solvent-based
- **Isolation** - Separate people from the hazard
  - Example: Barricade work area to keep people away
- **Engineering controls** - Physical changes to reduce risk
  - Example: Guardrails on scaffolding, ventilation for dust

**Level 3: Administrative Controls and PPE (Least Effective)**
- **Administrative controls** - Procedures and training
  - Example: Safe work method statements, permits, supervision
- **Personal protective equipment (PPE)**
  - Example: Hard hats, safety boots, respirators, hearing protection

> [!warning] Use Highest Level Reasonably Practicable
> Always use the highest level of control reasonably practicable. Lower levels only when higher levels are not reasonably practicable.

See [[Step-3-Control-Risks|Step 3: Control Risks]] for detailed guidance on each level.

## Step 4: Maintain and Review

Controls must be maintained and reviewed to ensure they remain effective.

### When to Review

- **Regularly** - scheduled reviews based on risk level
- **Before changes** - new equipment, processes, or work methods
- **After incidents** - following injuries, near-misses, or failures
- **When consultation indicates** - workers report controls not working
- **When new information** - new hazards identified or better controls available

### What to Review

- Are controls still in place and working as designed?
- Are workers using controls correctly?
- Have new hazards been introduced?
- Are better controls now available?
- Do workers have concerns about controls?

See [[Step-4-Maintain-and-Review|Step 4: Maintain and Review]] for detailed guidance.

## Consultation Throughout Risk Management

[[_Consultation-Overview|Consult with workers]] at each step:

1. **Identifying hazards** - Workers know the actual hazards they face
2. **Assessing risks** - Workers understand likelihood and consequences
3. **Controlling risks** - Workers can suggest practical controls
4. **Reviewing controls** - Workers know if controls are working

> [!tip] Worker Input is Essential
> Workers doing the job have the best knowledge of hazards and practical controls. Their input makes risk management more effective.

## Reasonably Practicable

All risk management duties are qualified by "so far as is reasonably practicable."

### What is Reasonably Practicable?

Weighing the risk against what is required to eliminate or minimize it, considering:

- **Likelihood** of the hazard/risk occurring
- **Degree of harm** that might result
- **What you know** (or ought to know) about the hazard, risk, and controls
- **Availability and suitability** of control measures
- **Cost** of controls (balanced against the risk)

> [!important] Higher Risks Require Greater Effort
> The greater the risk, the more must be done to eliminate or minimize it. Cost alone is never a reason to not implement necessary controls.

## High-Risk Construction Work

Certain construction work is classified as **high-risk construction work** requiring additional controls:

### Safe Work Method Statements (SWMS) Required

SWMS must be prepared before commencing:
- Work at heights (> 2 metres risk of fall)
- Confined space entry
- Demolition
- Excavation (> 1.5 metres deep or risk of person falling in)
- Use of explosives
- Work near energized electrical installations
- Work on roads with traffic exposure
- Tilt-up and precast concrete work
- Diving work
- Work in or near water/other liquid (drowning risk)
- Work in underground shafts or tunnels
- Use of pressurized gas distribution mains

See [[SWMS|Safe Work Method Statements]] for detailed requirements.

### High-Risk Work Licences

Certain work requires workers to hold licences:
- Scaffolding (basic, intermediate, advanced)
- Rigging (basic, intermediate, advanced)
- Dogging
- Cranes (various classes)
- Forklifts
- Boom-type elevating work platforms (EWP)
- Pressure equipment
- Confined space entry (in some situations)

## Practical Application: Construction Site Example

**Scenario:** Constructing a two-storey commercial building

### Step 1: Identify Hazards

Walk site and identify:
- Fall risks (slab edges, roof work, scaffolding)
- Plant risks (excavator, concrete trucks, cranes)
- Electrical risks (power tools, temporary wiring, nearby power lines)
- Manual handling (materials, formwork, reinforcement)
- Silica dust (concrete cutting/grinding)
- Noise (power tools, equipment)

### Step 2: Assess Risks

Prioritize based on likelihood and severity:
- **High risk:** Falls from slab edges (likely, severe injury/death)
- **High risk:** Excavator striking underground services (possible, severe injury/death)
- **Medium risk:** Manual handling injuries (likely, moderate injury)
- **Medium risk:** Silica dust exposure (certain, serious long-term health effects)

### Step 3: Control Risks

Apply hierarchy of control:

**Falls from edges:**
- Level 1: Prefabricate where possible to minimize work at heights
- Level 2: Install permanent edge protection (guardrails)
- Level 2: Provide scaffolding with edge protection for work areas
- Level 3: Fall arrest systems for areas where guardrails not practicable
- Level 3: SWMS for all work at heights

**Excavator and services:**
- Level 1: Relocate services before excavation (not practicable)
- Level 2: Locate and mark all services (Dial Before You Dig)
- Level 2: Hand dig within 500mm of located services
- Level 3: Competent excavator operator trained in service awareness
- Level 3: Spotter present during excavation near services

**Silica dust:**
- Level 1: Eliminate cutting where possible (order pre-cut materials)
- Level 2: Substitute lower-silica materials where possible
- Level 2: Water suppression and on-tool dust extraction
- Level 2: Isolate cutting work from other workers
- Level 3: Limit exposure time through work rotation
- Level 3: Fitted respirators when engineering controls inadequate

### Step 4: Maintain and Review

- Daily: Check edge protection intact, water supply for dust suppression
- Weekly: Inspect scaffolding, test dust extraction equipment
- After incidents: Investigate and modify controls if needed
- Monthly: Review incident reports and worker feedback
- When changes occur: Reassess risks for new work methods or areas
