# Level 2: Substitution

## Replace with Less Hazardous Alternative

Substitution means replacing a hazardous substance, process, or equipment with something less hazardous.

**If hazard cannot be eliminated, reduce it.**

## Why Substitution is Effective

**Advantages:**
- Reduces hazard at the source
- Doesn't rely on worker behavior
- Often permanent solution
- May improve process efficiency

**Limitation:**
- Doesn't completely eliminate risk (unlike Level 1)
- Substitute may have different (though lesser) hazards

## When to Consider Substitution

**Before purchasing:**
- Specify less hazardous alternatives
- Compare products for safety

**Reviewing existing materials:**
- Can current materials be replaced?
- Are safer alternatives now available?

**After incidents:**
- Was the hazardous material necessary?
- Could safer alternative prevent recurrence?

## Types of Substitution

### Chemical Substitution

**Replace hazardous chemical with less hazardous alternative:**

**Flammability:**
- Water-based paints/coatings instead of solvent-based
- Aqueous cleaning solutions instead of petroleum solvents
- Water-based adhesives instead of solvent-based

**Toxicity:**
- Low-VOC or zero-VOC products
- Non-toxic rust removers instead of acidic products
- Lead-free paints

**Carcinogenicity:**
- Non-asbestos materials (already mandated)
- Silica-free abrasives for blasting
- Alternatives to formaldehyde-releasing products

**Construction Example:**
Substitute water-based concrete curing compound for solvent-based. Reduces flammability risk, vapor inhalation, and environmental impact while achieving same result.

### Material Substitution

**Replace hazardous material with safer material:**

**Dust Generation:**
- Pre-mixed materials instead of powder (less dust when opening/using)
- Paste/gel forms instead of powders
- Pelletized materials instead of dusty granules

**Weight:**
- Lightweight blocks instead of dense concrete blocks (manual handling)
- Aluminum instead of steel (where strength permits)
- Composite materials instead of solid timber (less weight)

**Toxicity:**
- Treated timber with less toxic preservatives
- Non-toxic insulation materials

**Construction Example:**
Use lightweight hebel blocks instead of dense concrete blocks. Reduces manual handling strain (12kg vs 20kg) while providing same structural performance.

### Equipment/Plant Substitution

**Replace with safer equipment:**

**Noise:**
- Electric tools instead of pneumatic (quieter)
- Low-noise equipment models
- Hydraulic instead of diesel-powered

**Vibration:**
- Anti-vibration tools
- Low-vibration equipment models

**Safety Features:**
- Equipment with better guarding
- Plant with operator protection (ROPS, FOPS)
- Equipment with automatic safety features

**Construction Example:**
Use electric-powered concrete saw instead of petrol-powered. Quieter (90dB vs 110dB), no exhaust fumes, lower vibration, easier to start.

### Process Substitution

**Change how work is done to reduce hazards:**

**Manual to Mechanical:**
- Mechanical fastening instead of welding (eliminates fumes, fire risk)
- Mechanical couplings instead of flange bolting (less manual handling)

**Wet Instead of Dry:**
- Wet concrete cutting instead of dry (reduces silica dust)
- Wet grinding/demolition (suppresses dust)

**Different Technique:**
- Bolted connections instead of welded (easier to dismantle, no hot work)
- Spray application instead of brush/roller (faster, less repetitive motion)

**Construction Example:**
Use mechanical rock splitters instead of jackhammers for demolition. Quieter, less vibration, no dust, easier on operator.

## Assessing Substitutes

### Don't Create New Hazards

**Ensure substitute is actually safer:**
- Check Safety Data Sheet (SDS) for chemical substitutes
- Compare hazards (both must be considered)
- Consider lifecycle impacts

**Example of Poor Substitution:**
Replacing flammable solvent with toxic (but non-flammable) chemical. Reduced one hazard but introduced another - may not be improvement.

### Verify Performance

**Substitute must do the job:**
- Achieves required outcome
- Meets specifications
- Compatible with materials/process

**Example:**
Water-based paint must provide same protection, adhesion, durability as solvent-based paint it replaces.

### Consider Practicality

**Will it work in practice?**
- Application method compatible with workflow
- Available from suppliers
- Workers trained in use
- Cost reasonable

### Trial and Evaluate

**Before full implementation:**
- Test substitute on small scale
- Evaluate effectiveness
- Get worker feedback
- Monitor for unexpected issues

## Practical Construction Examples

### Example 1: Concrete Release Agent

**Original:** Solvent-based release oil

**Hazards:**
- Flammable (flash point 40°C)
- Harmful vapors
- Skin irritant
- Environmental impact

**Substitute:** Water-based release agent

**Advantages:**
- Non-flammable
- Low VOC
- Minimal odor
- Easier cleanup
- Safer for environment

**Result:** Eliminated flammability risk, reduced vapor exposure, improved worker acceptance. Same concrete finish quality.

### Example 2: Abrasive Blasting Media

**Original:** Silica sand for blasting

**Hazards:**
- Respirable crystalline silica (causes silicosis)
- Serious long-term health effects

**Substitute:** Non-silica abrasives (garnet, steel grit, glass beads, crushed walnut shells)

**Advantages:**
- Eliminates silica exposure
- May be recyclable (garnet, steel grit)
- Effective surface preparation

**Considerations:**
- Different media for different applications
- Cost may be higher
- May require equipment adjustment

**Result:** Silica exposure eliminated, same surface preparation achieved.

### Example 3: Cleaning Product

**Original:** Hydrochloric acid for concrete cleaning

**Hazards:**
- Corrosive (burns skin, eyes)
- Toxic fumes
- Requires PPE, specialized disposal

**Substitute:** Phosphoric acid-based cleaner or enzymatic cleaner

**Advantages:**
- Less corrosive
- Safer to handle
- Reduced PPE requirements
- Easier disposal

**Verification:**
Trial showed effective cleaning with longer application time (acceptable trade-off).

**Result:** Reduced corrosion hazard, safer for workers, same cleaning result with minor process adjustment.

## When Substitution Not Sufficient

If substitution reduces but doesn't adequately control the risk, additional controls required:

**Add Level 2 Engineering Controls:**
- [[Level-2-Isolation|Isolation]]
- [[Level-2-Engineering-Controls|Engineering Controls]]

**Add Level 3 Controls:**
- [[Level-3-Administrative-Controls|Administrative Controls]]
- [[Level-3-PPE|Personal Protective Equipment]]

**Example:**
Substituting water-based paint for solvent-based reduces flammability and vapor exposure but may still require ventilation (engineering control) and gloves (PPE) for skin protection.

## Information Sources

**Finding Safer Alternatives:**
- Safety Data Sheets (compare hazard sections)
- Supplier technical information
- Industry associations
- SafeWork Australia guidance materials
- Similar industries (may have already found solutions)

**Chemical Substitution:**
- Australian Government ChemAlert database
- International Chemical Toolkit (ILO)
- Supplier recommendations

## Consultation

**Involve workers when considering substitution:**
- They know practical issues with current materials
- Can trial alternatives and provide feedback
- More likely to accept change if involved

**Example:**
Workers trialing new cleaning product can report on effectiveness, ease of use, any issues - ensuring substitute actually works in practice.

## Summary

**Substitution:**
- Replace hazardous with less hazardous
- Reduces risk at source
- Permanent solution
- Must verify substitute is actually safer and performs adequately

**Key Principle:**
If you can't eliminate the hazard (Level 1), reduce it through substitution before accepting lower-level controls.
