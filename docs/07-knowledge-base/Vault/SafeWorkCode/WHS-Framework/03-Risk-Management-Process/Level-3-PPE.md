# Level 3: Personal Protective Equipment (PPE)

## Last Line of Defense

PPE provides barrier between worker and hazard but does not eliminate or reduce hazard itself.

> [!important] Last Resort
> PPE is least effective control. Use only after higher-level controls implemented or while higher controls being developed.

## Why PPE is Least Effective

**Limitations:**

**Doesn't Remove Hazard:**
- Hazard still present
- If PPE fails, full exposure occurs

**Relies on Correct Use:**
- Must be worn properly and consistently
- Gaps, improper fit reduce effectiveness dramatically
- Human error common

**Provides No Protection When Not Worn:**
- Workers may remove during breaks but remain in hazardous area
- Discomfort leads to non-compliance

**Requires Maintenance:**
- Must be kept clean, undamaged
- Regular replacement needed
- Storage affects lifespan

**Protects Only Individual:**
- Each person needs own PPE
- Doesn't protect others nearby

## When PPE Appropriate

**Supplement to higher controls:**
- Additional protection where engineering controls reduce but don't eliminate risk
- Example: Respirator while using on-tool dust extraction (belt and suspenders)

**Residual risks:**
- Low-level risks remaining after engineering controls
- Example: Safety glasses when working with hand tools

**Temporary protection:**
- While developing/installing engineering controls
- Emergency situations

**Short-duration, low-frequency tasks:**
- Where engineering controls not reasonably practicable
- Combined with administrative controls

## Types of PPE

### Head Protection

**Hard Hats (AS/NZS 1801):**
- Protects from falling objects, head strikes
- **Mandatory on construction sites**
- Types: General purpose, high-impact, electrical insulating

**Selection:**
- Certified to Australian Standard
- Appropriate for hazards (electrical work requires electrical-rated)
- Correct size, adjustable suspension

**Maintenance:**
- Inspect daily (cracks, dents, degradation)
- Replace after impact
- Replace every 2-5 years (UV degradation)

### Eye and Face Protection

**Safety Glasses (AS/NZS 1337):**
- Impact protection (flying particles, dust)
- Side shields recommended

**Goggles:**
- Better seal around eyes
- Protection from dust, chemical splash, molten metal

**Face Shields:**
- Full face protection
- Grinding, chemical handling, welding
- Use with safety glasses (additional protection)

**Welding Helmets:**
- Protect from arc radiation, sparks, spatter
- Auto-darkening or passive lens

**Selection based on hazard:**
- Impact: Safety glasses/goggles
- Chemical splash: Goggles/face shield
- Welding: Welding helmet with correct shade

### Hearing Protection

**Earplugs:**
- Inserted in ear canal
- Disposable foam or reusable pre-molded
- Typical attenuation: 20-30dB
- Require correct insertion (training)

**Earmuffs:**
- Cups over ears
- Typical attenuation: 20-35dB
- Easier to achieve good seal
- More visible (supervision easier)

**Selection:**
- Calculate required attenuation (noise level - 85dB)
- Comfort (more likely to be worn)
- Compatible with other PPE (hard hat, safety glasses)

See [[Managing-Noise-and-Preventing-Hearing-Loss|Noise Management]].

### Respiratory Protection

**Disposable Respirators (P1, P2, P3):**
- **P1:** Nuisance dusts (limited protection)
- **P2:** Mechanically generated particles (construction dust, wood dust)
- **P3:** Toxic particles, very fine particles

**Half-Face/Full-Face Respirators:**
- Reusable facepiece with replaceable cartridges/filters
- Cartridge type depends on contaminant (particulate, organic vapor, acid gas)

**Powered Air-Purifying Respirators (PAPR):**
- Battery-powered fan draws air through filter
- Positive pressure (better protection, more comfortable)
- For high-exposure situations

**Supplied-Air Respirators:**
- Continuous fresh air supply via hose
- For very high-exposure or oxygen-deficient atmospheres

**Critical Requirements:**
- **Fit testing** (quantitative testing to ensure seal)
- Clean-shaven (facial hair prevents seal)
- Medical clearance (breathing resistance)
- Training in use, limitations, maintenance

**When Required:**
- Silica dust exposure (P2 minimum, often PAPR for engineered stone)
- Welding fumes (P2)
- Asbestos work (P1 or P2 depending on work)
- Chemical vapors (appropriate cartridge)

See [[Managing-Risks-of-Respirable-Crystalline-Silica|Silica Dust]].

### Hand Protection

**Gloves - select for specific hazard:**

**Cut-resistant:** Handling sharp materials (glass, metal)

**Chemical-resistant:** Specific chemical (check SDS):
- Nitrile (oils, solvents, some chemicals)
- PVC (acids, bases)
- Neoprene (broader chemical resistance)
- Butyl rubber (specific chemicals)

**Impact-resistant:** Operating vibrating equipment

**Thermal:** Hot surfaces, cold environments

**General purpose:** Light mechanical work

**Limitations:**
- Reduce dexterity
- May get caught in machinery (don't use near rotating parts)
- Must be correct material for chemical (wrong glove = no protection)

### Foot Protection

**Safety Boots (AS/NZS 2210):**
- Steel or composite toe cap (crush protection)
- Penetration-resistant sole (nails, sharp objects)
- Slip-resistant sole
- **Mandatory on construction sites**

**Additional features:**
- Electrical hazard protection
- Metatarsal protection (top of foot)
- Ankle support

### High-Visibility Clothing

**AS/NZS 4602:**
- Day use (fluorescent material)
- Night use (retroreflective tape)
- **Mandatory on construction sites**

**Purpose:**
- Ensure workers visible to plant operators, vehicles
- Critical for traffic areas

### Fall Protection PPE

**Full-Body Harness:**
- With shock-absorbing lanyard or self-retracting lifeline
- Anchor point required
- Rescue plan mandatory

See [[Managing-Risk-of-Falls|Falls from Heights]].

### Other PPE

**Protective Clothing:**
- Coveralls (dust, chemical splash)
- Aprons (chemical handling, welding)
- Sun protection (broad-brim hats, long sleeves)

**Knee Pads:**
- For kneeling work (tiling, flooring)
- Reduces knee strain and injury

## PPE Management

### Selection

**Match PPE to hazard:**
- Assess hazard (what protection needed?)
- Consult Australian Standards
- Check manufacturer specifications
- Consider compatibility with other PPE

**Involve workers:**
- Trial different options
- Comfort affects compliance
- Get feedback

### Provision

**Employer must provide:**
- PPE at no cost to worker
- Correct type and size
- Adequate quantities
- Replacement when worn/damaged

### Training

**Workers must be trained:**
- What PPE required and why
- How to wear correctly (fit testing for respirators)
- How to inspect for damage
- When to replace
- Limitations of PPE
- Storage and maintenance

### Maintenance

**Regular:**
- Cleaning (according to manufacturer instructions)
- Inspection before each use
- Storage in clean, dry location
- Replacement schedule

**Replace when:**
- Damaged
- Degraded (UV, chemicals, age)
- After significant impact (hard hats)
- Filters/cartridges exhausted

### Monitoring Compliance

**Supervisors check:**
- PPE being worn
- Worn correctly
- Appropriate for hazard
- Good condition

**Non-compliance:**
- Understand why (discomfort, doesn't fit, not available?)
- Address underlying issues
- Reinforce importance

## Practical Construction Example

**Task:** Grinding concrete (silica dust, noise, flying particles)

**Controls Implemented:**

**Engineering (Level 2):**
- Wet grinding with water suppression
- On-tool vacuum extraction
- Work outdoors (natural ventilation)

**Administrative (Level 3):**
- SWMS prepared
- Trained operator
- Time limits (1-hour blocks, rotation)

**PPE (Level 3):**
- **P2 respirator** (fit-tested) - silica dust protection
- **Safety glasses** with side shields - flying particles
- **Earmuffs** (Class 4, 28dB attenuation) - noise protection (grinder 100dB)
- **Gloves** - vibration reduction, hand protection
- **Hard hat, safety boots, hi-vis** - general construction PPE

**Result:** Multiple layers of protection. Engineering controls reduce silica and noise exposure. PPE provides additional protection if engineering controls not 100% effective.

## Summary

**PPE:**
- Last line of defense
- Does not eliminate hazard
- Only effective if worn correctly and consistently
- Requires selection, training, maintenance, monitoring
- Always supplement to higher-level controls

**Key Principle:**
PPE protects the worker, not the workplace. Use PPE only after implementing elimination, substitution, isolation, and engineering controls.
