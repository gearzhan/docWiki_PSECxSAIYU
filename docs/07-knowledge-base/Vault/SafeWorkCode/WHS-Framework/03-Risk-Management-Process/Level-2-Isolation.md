# Level 2: Isolation

## Separate People from Hazard

Isolation means separating people from the hazard using distance or physical barriers.

**If people can't reach the hazard, they can't be harmed by it.**

## Why Isolation is Effective

**Advantages:**
- Controls hazard at source (doesn't require eliminating it)
- Physical separation provides reliable protection
- Protects multiple workers simultaneously
- Doesn't rely heavily on worker behavior

**Limitations:**
- Doesn't remove hazard (unlike elimination)
- Requires maintaining barriers/separation
- May interfere with work access

## Types of Isolation

### Physical Separation (Distance)

**Increase distance between workers and hazard:**

**Construction Examples:**

**Relocate Hazardous Operations:**
- Mixing/batching area away from main work areas (dust, noise, chemical exposure)
- Concrete cutting area separated from other work (dust, noise)
- Fuel/chemical storage remote from accommodation and ignition sources

**Exclusion Zones:**
- Barricaded area around operating plant (excavators, cranes)
- Marked zones around overhead work (falling object risk)
- Restricted areas near electrical hazards

**Buffer Distances:**
- Stockpiles away from excavation edges (prevent surcharge loading)
- Scaffolding from powerlines (electrical safety distances)

**Practical Example:**
Concrete batching plant located 50 meters from main construction area. Cement dust, noise, and truck movements isolated from other workers.

### Physical Barriers

**Install barriers between workers and hazard:**

**Permanent Barriers:**
- Fencing around plant and equipment
- Machine guards (fixed guards over moving parts)
- Screens separating work areas
- Enclosures for noise sources

**Temporary Barriers:**
- Barricades around hazards
- Hoarding/fencing around construction sites
- Mesh screens on scaffolding (falling objects)
- Curtains/partitions separating work zones

**Construction Examples:**

**Site Hoarding:**
- 1.8m+ fencing around construction site perimeter
- Separates public from construction hazards
- Prevents unauthorized entry

**Guardrails/Edge Protection:**
- Barriers at edges of floors, roofs, excavations
- Physically prevents falls
- Most reliable fall protection

**Scaffold Debris Netting:**
- Mesh attached to scaffold
- Catches falling tools/materials
- Protects workers and public below

**Acoustic Barriers:**
- Temporary walls/screens around noisy equipment
- Reduces noise exposure to nearby workers

### Segregation

**Separate incompatible hazards:**

**Chemical Storage:**
- Separate flammable liquids from oxidizers
- Acids stored separately from bases
- Incompatible chemicals in separate cabinets/areas

**Work Areas:**
- Hot work separated from flammable materials
- Painting/coating area separate from spark-producing operations

**Traffic Management:**
- Pedestrian routes separated from vehicle routes
- Dedicated walkways with physical barriers

**Practical Example:**
Site layout with dedicated fenced pedestrian walkways separate from vehicle routes. Workers physically isolated from mobile plant and delivery vehicles.

### Enclosure

**Enclose the hazard:**

**Complete Enclosure:**
- Acoustic enclosure around compressor/generator (noise control)
- Enclosed booth for spray painting (vapor/overspray control)
- Covered enclosure for dust-producing work

**Partial Enclosure:**
- Guards on power tools (blade guards, vacuum shrouds)
- Splash shields on grinding wheels
- Extraction hoods over welding stations

**Construction Example:**
Diesel generator in acoustic enclosure (shipping container with ventilation and sound insulation). Noise reduced from 95dB to 70dB at 10 meters. Workers can work nearby without hearing protection.

## Isolation vs. Engineering Controls

**Overlap exists** - many isolation methods also engineering controls.

**General distinction:**
- **Isolation:** Emphasis on separating people from hazard (barriers, distance)
- **Engineering Controls:** Emphasis on controlling the hazard itself (ventilation, equipment modification)

**Practically:** Both are Level 2 controls and often used together.

## Maintaining Isolation

**Critical requirements:**

**Barriers Must:**
- Remain in place and intact
- Be strong enough to resist impact, loads
- Be clearly marked/visible
- Not be easily bypassed or removed

**Distance Must:**
- Be maintained (don't move hazard closer)
- Be enforced (workers don't enter exclusion zones)
- Be marked clearly

**Inspections:**
- Regular checks barriers undamaged
- Exclusion zones respected
- Signage visible

## Practical Construction Examples

### Example 1: Excavation Work

**Hazard:** Workers or public falling into excavation (2m deep).

**Isolation Controls:**

**Barriers:**
- Temporary fencing 1.5m from excavation edge (prevents approach)
- Orange mesh fencing with high visibility
- "DANGER - OPEN EXCAVATION" signs

**Result:** Physical barrier prevents falls. Anyone who needs to approach (e.g., for inspection) must deliberately open/bypass barrier - conscious decision, not accidental approach.

### Example 2: Overhead Powerlines

**Hazard:** Crane boom contacting 11kV powerlines (electrocution risk).

**Isolation Controls:**

**Goal Post Barriers:**
- Physical frame installed around work area
- Height/position prevents crane reaching powerlines
- Highly visible (painted yellow/black)

**Spotter:**
- Dedicated person monitors clearances
- Stops work if approach too close

**Result:** Physical barrier and human monitoring isolate crane from powerlines.

### Example 3: Noisy Equipment

**Hazard:** Concrete saw generating 110dB noise.

**Isolation Controls:**

**Acoustic Barrier:**
- Temporary noise screens (3m high) around cutting area
- Absorptive/reflective panels reduce noise transmission

**Distance:**
- Cutting area 20m from other work
- Reduces noise at distance (inverse square law)

**Exclusion Zone:**
- 5m barricaded exclusion zone around saw
- Only operator in zone (wearing hearing protection)
- Other workers kept at distance

**Result:** Noise reduced to <85dB for workers outside zone. Operator protected by hearing protection and limited exposure time.

### Example 4: Chemical Storage

**Hazard:** Incompatible chemicals (flammable liquids and oxidizers).

**Isolation Controls:**

**Separate Storage:**
- Flammable liquids cabinet in one location
- Oxidizers cabinet 5 meters away
- Physical separation prevents contact if leak/spill

**Bunding:**
- Each cabinet in separate bunded area
- Spills contained, cannot mix

**Signage:**
- Clear labels on cabinets
- Hazard warnings

**Result:** Incompatible chemicals isolated from each other. If leak occurs, cannot cause dangerous reaction.

## When Isolation Not Sufficient

If isolation reduces but doesn't adequately control risk, add:

**Additional Level 2 Controls:**
- [[Level-2-Engineering-Controls|Engineering Controls]]
- Combination of isolation + engineering often most effective

**Level 3 Controls:**
- [[Level-3-Administrative-Controls|Administrative Controls]]
- [[Level-3-PPE|Personal Protective Equipment]]

**Example:**
Isolating spray painting in separate booth (isolation) + extraction ventilation (engineering control) + respirators for painter (PPE) = layered protection.

## Common Isolation Applications in Construction

**Site Security:**
- Perimeter fencing (public from hazards)
- Locked gates (unauthorized entry)

**Edge Protection:**
- Guardrails at fall edges
- Covers over penetrations

**Exclusion Zones:**
- Around operating plant
- Below overhead work
- Near energized equipment

**Traffic Management:**
- Pedestrian/vehicle separation
- Barricaded walkways

**Hazardous Materials:**
- Chemical storage areas (fenced, signed)
- Asbestos removal zones (barricaded, signed)

**Noise/Dust Sources:**
- Screened or remote locations
- Timed for minimum worker exposure
