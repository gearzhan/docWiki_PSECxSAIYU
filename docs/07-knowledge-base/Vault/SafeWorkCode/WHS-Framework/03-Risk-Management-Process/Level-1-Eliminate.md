# Level 1: Elimination

## Most Effective Control

Elimination means completely removing the hazard from the workplace.

**If the hazard doesn't exist, the risk doesn't exist.**

> [!important] Always Consider First
> Elimination must always be considered first. Even if it seems expensive or difficult initially, elimination often proves most cost-effective over time by preventing incidents entirely.

## Why Elimination is Best

**Advantages:**
- 100% effective (no residual risk)
- Doesn't rely on worker behavior
- Doesn't require ongoing maintenance
- Protects everyone, not just those using controls
- Often cheaper long-term (no PPE, no monitoring, no incidents)

**Example:**
Eliminating work at heights by pre-fabricating at ground level is more reliable than fall arrest harnesses, which depend on correct use, maintenance, and rescue procedures.

## When to Consider Elimination

**At Design Stage:**
- Most opportunities for elimination
- Least expensive to implement
- Example: Design building with services accessible from ground level, eliminating need for roof access

**Before Starting Work:**
- Can the task be done differently?
- Can the hazardous substance be avoided?
- Can the dangerous equipment be unnecessary?

**When Introducing Changes:**
- New equipment, materials, or processes
- Opportunity to eliminate existing hazards

**After Incidents:**
- Why did hazard exist?
- Can it be eliminated to prevent recurrence?

## Practical Elimination Methods

### Modify the Process

**Remove the step that creates the hazard:**
- Use pre-mixed materials instead of mixing on-site (eliminates dust, manual handling)
- Use mechanical fastening instead of welding (eliminates fumes, fire risk)

**Construction Example:**
Using pre-cast concrete stairs instead of building on-site eliminates working at heights during formwork and pouring.

### Prefabrication and Off-Site Construction

**Work at ground level, lift into position:**
- Assemble wall frames on ground → crane into position
- Build roof trusses at ground level → crane to roof
- Prefabricate plumbing/electrical pods → install as complete units

**Benefits:**
- Eliminates most work at heights
- Better quality (controlled environment)
- Faster on-site installation
- Safer overall

**Construction Example:**
Prefabricated bathroom pods for multi-storey residential building eliminate plumbing, waterproofing, and tiling work in confined, elevated spaces. Pods craned into position, connected to services.

### Design Out Hazards

**During design phase:**
- Design structure without hazardous materials
- Provide permanent safe access for maintenance (eliminates temporary access risks)
- Design for easy, safe demolition

**Construction Example:**
Design commercial building with Building Maintenance Unit (permanent façade access system) eliminates need for rope access or external scaffolding for window cleaning and maintenance.

### Automation and Mechanization

**Remove workers from hazardous task:**
- Automated material handling (conveyors eliminate manual carrying)
- Remote operation (operator away from danger zone)
- Robotics (robot works in hazardous environment)

**Construction Example:**
Automated concrete screeding laser system eliminates workers manually screeding large slabs (reduces repetitive manual handling, wet concrete exposure).

### Change the Material

**Use non-hazardous alternative:**
- Specify materials without asbestos, lead, toxic components
- Use solid materials instead of those that create dust

**Construction Example:**
Specify water-based paints and coatings instead of solvent-based, eliminating volatile organic compound (VOC) exposure and flammability hazards.

### Remove the Need

**Question if work is necessary:**
- Can design change eliminate the need?
- Is there an alternative that avoids the hazard entirely?

**Construction Example:**
Install ducted services in accessible ceiling space instead of buried in slab. Eliminates need to core drill concrete (noise, dust, vibration) for future alterations.

## Barriers to Elimination

### "We've Always Done It This Way"

**Challenge assumptions:**
- Just because a method is traditional doesn't mean it's the only way
- Construction industry has evolved - new methods eliminate old hazards

**Example:**
"We always build formwork in place at heights" → Prefabrication eliminates this hazard

### "It's Too Expensive"

**Consider total cost:**
- Incident costs (injuries, delays, workers compensation)
- Ongoing control costs (PPE, monitoring, training)
- Productivity gains (often faster, easier)

**Example:**
Prefabricated elements may have higher upfront cost but eliminate fall risks, reduce overall project time, improve quality.

### "It's Not Practical"

**Consult with workers and specialists:**
- Those who do the work may know elimination methods
- Other industries may have solved similar problems
- Specialist designers can develop elimination solutions

**Example:**
"Can't avoid confined space entry to clean tank" → Redesign tank with large access hatches and spray-in-place cleaning system eliminates entry need.

### "Client Won't Allow It"

**Educate client on benefits:**
- Legal duty to eliminate risks (reasonably practicable)
- Long-term cost savings
- Reduced liability
- Better safety outcomes

**Designer's duty:**
Designers must design to eliminate risks. Client cannot override designer's WHS duties.

## Reasonably Practicable

Elimination must be done if reasonably practicable.

**Consider:**
- **Likelihood and severity of harm:** Higher risk requires greater effort to eliminate
- **Availability of elimination methods:** Are they known and accessible?
- **Cost vs. risk:** Balance cost against risk being addressed

**High risks almost always require elimination** if technically feasible, regardless of cost.

**Example:**
Eliminating fall risk from 20-meter height by using alternative access method (cherry picker instead of ladder) is reasonably practicable even if more expensive, due to high severity of potential harm.

## Practical Construction Examples

### Example 1: Installing Ceiling Insulation (Fall Risk)

**Hazard:** Falls through fragile ceiling material.

**Elimination Methods:**

**Option A:** Pre-install insulation before ceiling sheets fixed (work from stable floor, not ceiling)

**Option B:** Use blown-in insulation after ceiling complete (eliminates need to access ceiling cavity)

**Result:** Fall hazard eliminated entirely.

### Example 2: Concrete Cutting (Silica Dust)

**Hazard:** Respirable crystalline silica from cutting concrete.

**Elimination Methods:**

**Option A:** Order concrete slabs pre-cut to required dimensions (no on-site cutting)

**Option B:** Use core drilling with water suppression and vacuum extraction... wait, that's minimization, not elimination.

**Option A is elimination:** No cutting = no dust.

**Result:** Silica exposure completely eliminated.

### Example 3: Working in Confined Space (Multiple Hazards)

**Hazard:** Oxygen deficiency, toxic atmosphere, entrapment in tank.

**Elimination Methods:**

**Option A:** Redesign tank with large access panels and automated cleaning system (no entry required)

**Option B:** Remote inspection using cameras and sensors (eliminates entry need)

**Result:** Confined space entry hazard eliminated.

## When Elimination Not Reasonably Practicable

If elimination not reasonably practicable, must minimize risk using:

**Level 2 Controls:**
- [[Level-2-Substitution|Substitution]]
- [[Level-2-Isolation|Isolation]]
- [[Level-2-Engineering-Controls|Engineering Controls]]

**Level 3 Controls:**
- [[Level-3-Administrative-Controls|Administrative Controls]]
- [[Level-3-PPE|Personal Protective Equipment]]

See [[Step-3-Control-Risks|Step 3: Control Risks]] for complete hierarchy.

## Summary

**Elimination:**
- Removes hazard completely
- Most effective control
- Must be considered first
- Often most cost-effective long-term
- Achieved through design, prefabrication, process changes, automation

**Key Principle:**
If you can eliminate the hazard, you eliminate the risk entirely. Always explore elimination before accepting lower-level controls.
