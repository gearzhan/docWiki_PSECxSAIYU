## 4-Step Risk Management Process

### Step 1: Identify Hazards

**How:**
- Inspect workplace regularly
- Consult workers and HSRs
- Review incidents, near misses, records
- Consider design and planning opportunities

**Common Construction Hazards:**
- Falls (heights, slips, trips)
- Mobile plant and vehicles
- Electricity
- Hazardous substances (silica, asbestos, chemicals)
- Manual handling
- Confined spaces
- Noise
- Psychosocial (time pressure, bullying)

### Step 2: Assess Risks

**Questions:**
- How could harm occur?
- How severe could harm be? (death, serious injury, medical treatment, first aid)
- How likely is harm to occur? (certain, very likely, possible, unlikely, rare)

**Risk Level = Severity × Likelihood**

**Action Priority:**
- **Extreme:** Stop work immediately
- **High:** Immediate action required
- **Moderate:** Action within defined timeframe
- **Low:** Manage with routine procedures

### Step 3: Control Risks

**Hierarchy of Control (most effective to least):**

**Level 1: Elimination** (remove hazard entirely)
- Prefabricate at ground level instead of working at heights
- Use mechanical aids eliminating manual lifting

**Level 2: Minimize Risk**
- **Substitution:** Replace with less hazardous option (water-based paint vs. solvent-based)
- **Isolation:** Separate people from hazard (guardrails, exclusion zones)
- **Engineering:** Physical changes (dust extraction, machine guards, RCDs)

**Level 3: Administrative Controls + PPE** (least effective alone)
- Procedures, SWMS, training, signage, permits
- Hard hats, safety boots, hi-vis, respirators, harnesses

### Step 4: Maintain and Review

**Review When:**
- Controls not effective
- Before changes that may introduce new risks
- New hazards identified
- Consultation indicates review needed
- Scheduled intervals (high-risk: quarterly; moderate: six-monthly; low: annually)

---

## Emergency Planning Essentials

**Every Construction Site Must Have:**

**Emergency Plan Including:**
1. Evacuation procedures (routes, assembly points, signals)
2. Medical treatment procedures (first aid, calling 000)
3. Rescue procedures (heights, confined spaces, trenches)
4. Communication procedures (internal and with emergency services)
5. Testing procedures (drills, minimum quarterly)

**Emergency Contacts:**
- Emergency services: **000**
- SafeWork NSW: **13 10 50**
- Site supervisor: [mobile number]
- First aiders: [names/contact]

**Notifiable Incidents to SafeWork NSW:**
- Death of a person
- Serious injury or illness (hospitalization, amputation, serious burns, loss of consciousness)
- Dangerous incidents (collapse, explosion, fire, release of substance, uncontrolled implosion/explosion)

---

## Consultation Requirements

**Must Consult With Workers On (WHS Act s.47):**
- Identifying hazards and assessing risks
- Decisions about control measures
- Adequacy of worker facilities
- Proposed changes that may affect WHS
- Procedures for consultation, resolving issues, monitoring health, providing information/training

**Effective Consultation Involves:**
- Sharing relevant information
- Giving workers reasonable opportunity to express views
- Taking views into account
- Advising outcome of consultation

**Methods:**
- Toolbox talks
- Health and Safety Representatives (HSRs)
- WHS Committees
- SWMS reviews
- Incident investigations

---

## First Aid Requirements

**Minimum for Construction Sites:**

**First Aid Kits:**
- Adequate for workplace size and risks
- Readily accessible
- Maintained and restocked

**First Aiders:**
- Number based on:
  - Nature of work and associated risks
  - Size and location of workplace
  - Number and composition of workers

**Recommended Minimums:**
- Low-risk sites <25 workers: 1 first aider
- Low-risk sites 25-100 workers: 2 first aiders
- High-risk construction: 1 first aider per 25 workers

**High-risk sites may require:**
- Advanced first aid trained personnel
- Advanced first aid kits
- Dedicated first aid room
