# Hierarchy of Control - Quick Reference

## Overview

The **Hierarchy of Control** is a systematic approach to **eliminating or minimizing risks**, ordered from **most effective to least effective**.

> [!important] Legal Requirement (WHS Reg 36)
> When controlling risks, must implement controls in accordance with hierarchy:
> 1. Eliminate the hazard
> 2. If elimination not reasonably practicable, minimize risk by:
>    - Substitution
>    - Isolation  
>    - Engineering controls
> 3. If risk remains, minimize by:
>    - Administrative controls
>    - PPE

**Start at top, work down. Higher levels more effective.**

## The Six Levels

### Level 1: Elimination ✅ MOST EFFECTIVE

**Remove the hazard entirely.**

**Examples:**
- Design out fall hazard (prefabricate at ground level instead of working at heights)
- Don't do hazardous work (use alternative construction method)
- Remove asbestos before other work

**Why most effective:** No hazard = no risk

**Details:** [[Level-1-Eliminate|Elimination]]

---

### Level 2: Substitution

**Replace with something less hazardous.**

**Examples:**
- Water-based paint instead of solvent-based (reduced flammability, vapor exposure)
- Electric saw instead of petrol saw (lower noise, no exhaust fumes)
- Non-silica abrasive instead of silica sand for blasting

**Why effective:** Reduces hazard at source

**Details:** [[Level-2-Substitution|Substitution]]

---

### Level 2: Isolation

**Separate people from hazard.**

**Examples:**
- Guardrails at edges (physical barrier prevents falls)
- Barricade around excavation (prevents approach)
- Noisy equipment in acoustic enclosure or remote location
- Separate flammable storage from ignition sources

**Why effective:** People can't reach hazard, can't be harmed

**Details:** [[Level-2-Isolation|Isolation]]

---

### Level 2: Engineering Controls

**Control hazard through physical means.**

**Examples:**
- Local exhaust ventilation (captures silica dust at source)
- Water suppression for concrete cutting (binds dust)
- Machine guards (prevents contact with moving parts)
- RCDs on electrical equipment (cuts power if fault)
- Rollover protection on excavators

**Why effective:** Controls hazard at source, doesn't rely on human behavior

**Details:** [[Level-2-Engineering-Controls|Engineering Controls]]

---

### Level 3: Administrative Controls ⚠️ LESS EFFECTIVE

**Procedures, training, work practices to reduce exposure.**

**Examples:**
- Safe Work Method Statements (SWMS)
- Training in safe work procedures
- Job rotation (reduces exposure duration)
- Permits to work (hot work permit)
- Signage and warnings

**Why less effective:** Relies on human behavior (people forget, take shortcuts, may not understand importance)

**Details:** [[Level-3-Administrative-Controls|Administrative Controls]]

---

### Level 3: Personal Protective Equipment (PPE) ❌ LEAST EFFECTIVE

**Barrier between worker and hazard.**

**Examples:**
- Hard hats (falling objects)
- Safety glasses (flying particles)
- Hearing protection (noise)
- Respirators (dust, fumes)
- Safety harness (fall arrest)

**Why least effective:**
- Doesn't remove hazard (if PPE fails, full exposure)
- Relies on correct, consistent use
- Protects only individual wearing it
- Requires maintenance

**PPE only used:**
- After higher controls implemented
- As additional protection (supplement)
- For residual risks

**Details:** [[Level-3-PPE|Personal Protective Equipment]]

## Applying the Hierarchy - Construction Example

**Task:** Concrete grinding (silica dust, noise, flying particles)

### Hierarchy Application:

**Level 1 - Eliminate:**
- ❌ Can't eliminate grinding (required for surface preparation)

**Level 2 - Substitution:**
- ✅ Use diamond grinding wheel (produces less dust than abrasive wheel)

**Level 2 - Isolation:**
- ✅ Perform grinding in designated area, away from other workers
- ✅ Barricade area (prevents other workers entering dust cloud)

**Level 2 - Engineering:**
- ✅ Wet grinding (water suppression binds silica dust)
- ✅ On-tool vacuum extraction (HEPA filter captures dust at source)
- ✅ Grinder with low vibration handles

**Level 3 - Administrative:**
- ✅ SWMS prepared and followed
- ✅ Trained, competent operator
- ✅ Time limits (1-hour blocks, rotation between operators)
- ✅ Air monitoring to verify dust control effectiveness

**Level 3 - PPE:**
- ✅ P2 respirator (fit-tested) - additional protection for silica dust
- ✅ Earmuffs (Class 4, 28dB attenuation) - noise (grinder 100dB)
- ✅ Safety glasses with side shields - flying particles
- ✅ Gloves - vibration reduction
- ✅ Hard hat, safety boots, high-vis - general site PPE

**Result:** Multiple layers of control. Engineering controls substantially reduce silica and noise. PPE provides additional protection if engineering controls not 100% effective.

## Key Principles

**1. Start at top:**
Always consider elimination first. If not reasonably practicable, work down hierarchy.

**2. Combination of controls:**
Often most effective approach uses multiple levels (engineering + administrative + PPE).

**3. PPE is last resort:**
Never rely on PPE alone where higher-level controls reasonably practicable.

**4. Review regularly:**
As technology advances, higher-level controls may become available.

**5. Worker consultation:**
Workers often have practical insights on most effective controls.

## Quick Decision Tree

```
Can the hazard be eliminated?
├─ YES → Eliminate (Level 1) ✅
└─ NO → Can we substitute with less hazardous?
    ├─ YES → Substitute (Level 2)
    └─ NO → Can we isolate people from hazard?
        ├─ YES → Isolate (Level 2)
        └─ NO → Can we use engineering controls?
            ├─ YES → Engineering (Level 2)
            └─ NO → Risk still not adequately controlled?
                └─ YES → Add administrative + PPE (Level 3)
```

**At each step:** "Is risk now adequately controlled?"
- If YES: May still add lower-level controls as extra protection
- If NO: Continue down hierarchy and/or combine controls

## Common Mistakes

**❌ Starting with PPE:**
"We'll just wear respirators" → Should first try elimination, substitution, engineering controls

**❌ Administrative controls alone for serious risks:**
"We'll have a procedure and training" → Serious risks need engineering controls, not just procedures

**❌ Assuming elimination impossible without investigation:**
"We've always done it this way" → May be alternative methods that eliminate hazard

**❌ Using lower level when higher level reasonably practicable:**
"PPE is cheaper than engineering controls" → Cost alone doesn't determine reasonably practicable
