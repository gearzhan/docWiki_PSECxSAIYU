# Common WHS Scenarios - Practical Applications

## How WHS Framework Works in Practice

This page provides common construction scenarios showing how WHS duties, risk management, and hierarchy of control apply in real situations.

---

## Scenario 1: New Worker Starts on Site

### Situation
Apprentice carpenter starts first day on residential construction site.

### WHS Framework Application

**PCBU Duties:**
- Provide safe workplace ([[PCBU-Overview|PCBU duties]])
- Provide information, training, instruction
- Ensure adequate supervision

**Actions Required:**

1. **Site Induction** ([[Managing-Visitors|visitor management principles apply]])
   - White Card verified (general construction induction)
   - Site-specific induction (hazards, emergency procedures, PPE)
   - Induction record signed and filed

2. **PPE Provision** ([[Level-3-PPE|PPE requirements]])
   - Hard hat issued (AS/NZS 1801)
   - Safety boots verified (steel cap, AS/NZS 2210)
   - High-vis clothing provided if apprentice doesn't have
   - Safety glasses, hearing protection available

3. **Training and Supervision**
   - Assigned to experienced carpenter (supervision)
   - Shown safe work practices (tool use, housekeeping, hazard identification)
   - SWMS explained for tasks ([[SWMS|Safe Work Method Statements]])

4. **Consultation** ([[Consultation-with-Workers|consultation requirements]])
   - Encouraged to ask questions, raise concerns
   - Informed of HSR (if present)
   - Toolbox talk schedule explained

**Worker Duties:** ([[Workers|worker responsibilities]])
- Follow instructions
- Use PPE as instructed
- Report hazards
- Take reasonable care for own safety and others

## Scenario 2: Hazard Identified During Work

### Situation
Plumber discovers asbestos cement sheet behind wall during renovation work.

### WHS Framework Application

**Immediate Actions:**

1. **Stop Work** ([[Right-to-Refuse-Unsafe-Work|worker right to cease unsafe work]])
   - Plumber ceases work immediately
   - Doesn't disturb suspected asbestos further
   - Notifies supervisor

2. **Secure Area**
   - Supervisor cordons off area
   - "DANGER - POSSIBLE ASBESTOS" sign posted
   - No entry until confirmed safe

3. **Hazard Assessment**
   - Licensed asbestos assessor engaged
   - Samples taken and tested
   - Confirmed as asbestos cement sheet

4. **Control Implementation** ([[Asbestos-Overview|asbestos management]])
   - If removal required: Licensed asbestos removalist engaged
   - If left in place: Asbestos register updated, area sealed, signage maintained
   - Workers informed via toolbox talk

**Risk Management Process:** ([[_Risk-Management-Overview|4 steps]])
- **Identify:** Asbestos discovered
- **Assess:** High risk if disturbed (inhalation of asbestos fibers → lung disease)
- **Control:** Engage licensed removalist (elimination); seal and label if not removed (isolation)
- **Review:** Asbestos register updated, work method reviewed to prevent future unexpected finds

## Scenario 3: Working at Heights - Gutter Installation

### Situation
Need to install gutters on single-story house (4m working height).

### Hierarchy of Control Application

**Level 1 - Elimination:**
- ❌ Can't eliminate working at heights (gutters must be installed at eaves)

**Level 2 - Substitution:**
- ✅ Prefabricate gutter lengths at ground (minimize time at heights)

**Level 2 - Isolation:**
- ✅ Exclusion zone below work area (barricaded, prevents falling objects striking workers below)

**Level 2 - Engineering:**
- ✅ Scaffolding with edge protection (guardrails) - most reliable fall protection ([[Managing-Risk-of-Falls|fall protection hierarchy]])
- Alternative: Elevating work platform (EWP)

**Level 3 - Administrative:**
- ✅ SWMS for working at heights ([[SWMS|high-risk construction work]])
- ✅ Trained, competent workers
- ✅ Supervisor checks scaffolding before use
- ✅ Weather restrictions (no work in high wind, rain)

**Level 3 - PPE:**
- ✅ Hard hats (all workers, falling objects)
- ✅ If edge protection not practicable for specific task: Fall arrest harness + lanyard + anchor point (but edge protection preferred)

**Outcome:** Scaffolding with edge protection eliminates fall risk (most effective control). SWMS, training, and PPE provide additional layers.

## Scenario 4: Noise Hazard - Concrete Saw

### Situation
Need to cut concrete slab, saw generates 110dB noise.

### Risk Management Application

**Step 1 - Identify Hazard:**
- Concrete saw: 110dB at operator position, 95dB at 5 meters

**Step 2 - Assess Risk:**
- Exposure standard: 85dB(A) 8-hour TWA
- Operator: High risk of hearing damage (110dB far exceeds limit)
- Nearby workers: Risk if within 10 meters

**Step 3 - Control Risks (Hierarchy):**

**Elimination:**
- ❌ Can't eliminate cutting (required for construction)

**Substitution:**
- ✅ Electric saw instead of petrol (5-10dB quieter: 100-105dB)
- ✅ Diamond blade (quieter than abrasive)

**Isolation:**
- ✅ Cut in designated area, 20m from other work (distance reduces noise exposure to others)
- ✅ Acoustic barriers around cutting area (temporary noise screens)
- ✅ Exclusion zone (5m radius, only operator in zone)

**Engineering:**
- ✅ Saw with enclosed blade guard (reduces noise emission)
- ✅ Water suppression (wet cutting quieter than dry)

**Administrative:**
- ✅ SWMS for noisy work
- ✅ Time limits (1-hour blocks, rotation between operators → reduces individual exposure)
- ✅ Schedule cutting when fewer workers on site
- ✅ Training in saw use

**PPE:**
- ✅ Earmuffs (Class 5, 30dB attenuation) for operator → reduces 110dB to 80dB (below 85dB limit)
- ✅ Hearing protection for workers within 10m

**Step 4 - Review:**
- Noise monitoring to verify controls effective
- Worker feedback (can operators hear instructions? Too hot with earmuffs?)

**Outcome:** Combination of controls reduces operator exposure to safe level. ([[Managing-Noise-and-Preventing-Hearing-Loss|Noise management]])

## Scenario 5: Consultation on Site Change

### Situation
Principal contractor plans to change site access route (due to neighboring construction).

### Consultation Requirements ([[Consultation-with-Workers|when to consult]])

**Trigger:**
- Change may affect worker health and safety (vehicle/pedestrian movements, access to amenities)

**Consultation Process:**

1. **Information Sharing** ([[Effective-Consultation-Elements|effective consultation]])
   - Draft traffic management plan prepared
   - Shared with HSRs and workers (drawings, written explanation)
   - Reason explained (neighboring site blocks current access)

2. **Opportunity to Contribute**
   - Toolbox talk scheduled (paid time, all shifts)
   - Workers invited to provide feedback on proposed route
   - HSR reviews plan, raises concerns from work group

3. **Taking Views Into Account**
   - Workers identify issue: New route requires reversing near amenities (reversing hazard)
   - Suggestion: Extend one-way loop to avoid reversing
   - PCBU revises plan incorporating suggestion

4. **Advising Outcome**
   - Final traffic management plan shared
   - Email to all workers + subcontractors
   - Explanation: Worker feedback led to one-way loop (safer, eliminates reversing near pedestrians)
   - Implementation date confirmed

**Methods Used:**
- HSR consultation ([[Health-and-Safety-Representatives|HSR involvement]])
- Toolbox talks ([[Consultation-Methods|consultation methods]])
- Written communication

**Outcome:** Worker input improved safety of final plan. Consultation built engagement and compliance.

## Scenario 6: Incident Occurs - Investigation and Review

### Situation
Worker slips on wet floor in amenities, sprains ankle (lost time injury).

### Response and Review Process

**Immediate Response:**
- First aid provided ([[First-Aid|first aid requirements]])
- Worker transported to medical center
- Incident area secured

**Incident Investigation:** ([[Step-4-Maintain-and-Review|maintain and review]])

1. **Gather Information**
   - Interview injured worker, witnesses
   - Inspect area (wet floor, no warning sign, leak from tap)
   - Review maintenance records

2. **Identify Causes**
   - Immediate cause: Water on floor from leaking tap
   - Underlying cause: No regular maintenance inspection of amenities
   - Contributing factor: No wet floor signage available

3. **Identify Controls**
   - **Engineering:** Repair leak (immediate)
   - **Administrative:** 
     - Implement weekly amenities inspection (checklist)
     - Assign responsible person (cleaner)
     - Purchase wet floor signs (available for immediate use when needed)
   - **Training:** Toolbox talk on slip/trip hazards, reporting maintenance issues

4. **Consultation**
   - Incident discussed at HSR meeting
   - Workers asked: Other areas with slip risks? Any leaks not reported?
   - Additional issue identified (poor drainage at wash area) → added to maintenance schedule

5. **Implementation and Review**
   - Controls implemented
   - After 1 month: Review effectiveness (no further slip incidents, inspections being completed, leaks reported and repaired promptly)

**Regulatory:**
- Notifiable incident? No (not serious injury requiring immediate treatment or hospitalization)
- Record in site incident register
- Report to insurer (workers compensation claim)

**Outcome:** Incident investigated, controls improved, prevented recurrence.

## Scenario 7: Multiple Duty Holders - Coordination

### Situation
Principal contractor, electrical subcontractor, and scaffolding contractor all working in same area.

### Cooperation and Coordination ([[Cooperation-and-Coordination|multiple duty holders]])

**Shared Duties:**
- All three PCBUs have duty for workers' safety in shared area
- All have duty to ensure others not put at risk

**Coordination Actions:**

1. **Communication**
   - Weekly coordination meeting (all PCBUs represented)
   - Share work schedules, hazards, control measures

2. **Shared WHS Management Plan** ([[WHS-Management-Plan|WHS management planning]])
   - Principal contractor's plan includes coordination arrangements
   - Each PCBU's SWMS cross-referenced

3. **Specific Coordination**
   - **Electrical subcontractor:** Needs to isolate power to install switchboard
   - **Coordination:** Power isolation scheduled, other trades notified, work in affected areas rescheduled
   - **Scaffolding contractor:** Modifying scaffold near electrical work
   - **Coordination:** Electrical work suspended while scaffold modified, scaffold contractor trained in electrical hazard awareness

4. **Incident Reporting**
   - Near-miss: Scaffold plank falls near electrical worker
   - All PCBUs notified immediately
   - Joint investigation (scaffold contractor and principal contractor)
   - Improved controls (scaffold edge protection, exclusion zone)

**Consultation:**
- HSRs from all companies meet monthly (joint WHS committee)
- Workers from different companies consulted on shared hazards

**Outcome:** Effective coordination prevents gaps in WHS management, ensures compatibility of controls.

## Scenario 8: Worker Refuses Unsafe Work

### Situation
Excavation operator refuses to enter trench, believes collapse risk.

### Issue Resolution ([[Right-to-Refuse-Unsafe-Work|right to refuse]])

**Worker Action:**
1. Observes ground cracking at trench edge after overnight rain
2. Reasonably believes serious risk (collapse → crushing)
3. Refuses to enter trench
4. Notifies supervisor and HSR

**Supervisor Response:**
1. Takes concern seriously (inspects area)
2. Observes cracking and water pooling
3. Agrees serious risk exists
4. Engages geotechnical engineer for assessment

**Resolution:**
- Engineer confirms ground instability
- Recommends benching and shoring
- Controls implemented
- Worker and HSR consulted, agree controls adequate
- Work resumes safely

**Outcome:**
- Worker's refusal was reasonable and prevented potential serious injury
- No adverse action against worker (paid for time not working)
- Issue resolved through consultation and implementing controls

**If disagreement had continued:**
- Issue resolution process ([[Issue-Resolution-Procedures|formal process]])
- Either party could request WorkSafe inspector
- Worker not required to perform work until resolved

---

## Scenario 9: High-Risk Construction Work - SWMS

### Situation
Demolition of internal walls in multi-story building.

### SWMS Requirements ([[SWMS|Safe Work Method Statements]])

**Trigger:** Demolition is high-risk construction work (WHS Reg 291)

**SWMS Preparation:**

1. **Before Work Starts:**
   - Licensed demolition contractor prepares SWMS
   - Identifies hazards: structural collapse, falling debris, dust (silica), noise, asbestos (if present)
   - Details step-by-step work method and controls for each step

2. **Consultation:**
   - SWMS prepared in consultation with workers performing work
   - Workers' practical knowledge incorporated (sequencing, access, equipment)

3. **Coordination:**
   - SWMS provided to principal contractor
   - Principal contractor reviews for compatibility with site WHS management plan
   - Other subcontractors notified of demolition work and hazards

4. **Implementation:**
   - SWMS explained to workers (toolbox talk)
   - Workers sign acknowledgment (understand and will follow)
   - Supervisor monitors compliance

5. **Review:**
   - SWMS reviewed if conditions change (asbestos discovered → method revised)
   - Worker feedback: Access difficult due to rubble → clean-up frequency increased

**Content Example:**

| Step | Hazards | Controls |
|------|---------|----------|
| 1. Isolate services | Electrical shock, gas leak | Licensed electrician isolates power; plumber caps gas; test before work |
| 2. Asbestos check | Asbestos exposure | Licensed assessor confirms no asbestos present (or method revised) |
| 3. Remove non-structural items | Manual handling, cuts | Team lifting, gloves, progressive lowering (no throwing) |
| 4. Demolish walls (top-down) | Structural collapse, falling debris | Engineer confirms sequence safe; exclusion zone below; wet suppression (dust); progressive removal |
| 5. Remove debris | Manual handling, silica dust | Excavator with enclosed cab; water suppression; waste management |

**Outcome:** Systematic approach to high-risk work, controls for each step, workers involved in method development.

## Key Takeaways

**WHS Framework Integration:**
- Duties, risk management, hierarchy of control, and consultation work together
- Each scenario shows multiple framework elements in practice
- Real-world application requires judgment and consultation

**Common Threads:**
- **Identify hazards early** (inspection, worker reports, during planning)
- **Consult workers** (practical knowledge improves controls)
- **Use hierarchy** (start with elimination, work down)
- **Combine controls** (multiple levels often most effective)
- **Review and improve** (incidents, feedback, changing conditions)

**Worker Engagement:**
- Workers identify hazards (they see the work up close)
- Workers suggest practical controls (they know what will work)
- Workers' concerns taken seriously (right to refuse, incident reporting)
