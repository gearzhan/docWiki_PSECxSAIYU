# Safe Design of Structures

## Designer Duties

Designers have specific WHS duties under WHS Act s.22 to ensure structures are designed to eliminate or minimize WHS risks.

**"Designer"** includes:
- Architects
- Engineers (structural, civil, mechanical, electrical)
- Building designers
- Draftspersons

See [[Designers|Designer Duties]] for comprehensive coverage.

## What is Safe Design?

Safe design integrates WHS considerations into design process to eliminate or minimize risks throughout structure's lifecycle:
- **Construction**
- **Use/occupation**
- **Maintenance**
- **Demolition**

## Design for Construction Safety

### Falls Prevention

**Design features:**
- Permanent edge protection (parapets, balustrades)
- Fixing points for temporary edge protection
- Safe roof access (permanent ladders, platforms)
- Avoid or minimize work at heights during construction

**Example:** Design roof with central walkway and anchor points for harnesses, eliminating need for workers to access fragile areas.

### Prefabrication

**Eliminate height risks:**
- Prefabricate wall panels, trusses at ground level
- Crane into position
- Reduces time working at heights

**Example:** Prefabricated bathroom pods reduce on-site plumbing/tiling work in confined, elevated spaces.

### Construction Sequence

**Design to allow safe sequence:**
- Consider how structure will be built (not just final form)
- Enable safe temporary works
- Provide support points for formwork

**Example:** Design floor slabs with edge details that allow guardrails to be installed before slab poured.

### Material Selection

**Consider:**
- Weight (lighter materials easier to handle manually or with smaller plant)
- Size (manageable units reduce manual handling risks)
- Toxicity (specify non-hazardous materials where possible)

**Example:** Specify lightweight concrete blocks instead of dense concrete blocks (easier manual handling).

## Design for Use and Maintenance

### Access for Maintenance

**Provide safe access to:**
- Roofs (gutters, equipment)
- Building services (HVAC, electrical, plumbing)
- Façade (cleaning, repairs)
- Confined spaces (tanks, plant rooms)

**Design features:**
- Permanent access ladders/stairs
- Platforms and walkways
- Anchor points for fall arrest
- Adequate headroom and workspace

**Example:** Roof design includes permanent platform around air conditioning units, with guardrails and access ladder.

### Eliminate Cleaning Risks

**Design to minimize:**
- Window cleaning at heights (specify self-cleaning glass or mechanical cleaning systems)
- Gutter cleaning risks (leaf guards, adequate roof drainage)

**Example:** Commercial building designed with Building Maintenance Unit (BMU) - permanent system for safe façade access.

### Services Access

**Avoid confined spaces:**
- Design accessible plant rooms (not cramped ceiling spaces)
- Provide adequate access openings (not squeeze-through hatches)
- Natural ventilation where possible

**Example:** Place electrical switchboards in dedicated, accessible room rather than ceiling space.

## Design for Demolition

**Consider end-of-life:**
- Modular construction (easier to dismantle)
- Document hazardous materials used (future reference)
- Removable connections (less cutting/breaking required)

**Example:** Steel-framed building with bolted connections can be disassembled with less dust/noise/vibration than concrete demolition.

## Information to Provide

### Designer's Safety Report

Designers should prepare report covering:

**1. Purpose and Limits of Design**
- Intended use
- Load limits
- Design life

**2. Hazards and Risks**
- Hazards that could not be eliminated by design
- Residual risks requiring controls

**3. Safe Work Recommendations**
- Suggested construction methods
- Required temporary works
- Recommended equipment
- Maintenance procedures

**4. Hazardous Materials**
- Materials used in design (asbestos, lead paint, treated timber)
- Location and quantity
- Safe handling/removal requirements

### When to Provide

- With design documentation
- Before construction/installation begins
- Update if design changes

### Who Receives

- Client/building owner
- Principal contractor
- Future occupants/owners

## Consultation

Designers must consult with:
- Others involved in design (multi-disciplinary teams)
- PCBUs who will construct structure
- Future users (where known)

**Purpose:**
- Share WHS knowledge
- Identify hazards early
- Develop practical solutions

**Example:** Architect consults with scaffolder during design to ensure building façade allows safe scaffold installation.

## Practical Examples

### Example 1: Residential Roof Design

**Hazard:** Falls during construction and maintenance.

**Design Solutions:**

**For Construction:**
- Trusses prefabricated on ground
- Crane lift into position
- Temporary edge protection fixing points on slab edge
- Roof battens designed to support safety mesh installation

**For Maintenance:**
- Install permanent gutter guard (eliminates gutter cleaning)
- Roof anchor points at ridge for harness attachment
- Safe access via permanent roof ladder (fixed to wall)

**Information Provided:**
- Truss drawings showing lift points
- Specification for edge protection fixings
- Anchor point load ratings and installation instructions

### Example 2: Commercial Building HVAC Access

**Hazard:** Falls and confined space risks accessing rooftop equipment.

**Design Solutions:**

**Access:**
- Internal staircase to roof (not external ladder)
- Landing at roof access door
- Permanent walkways between equipment (1.2m wide, guardrails)

**Work Area:**
- Platforms around all equipment (adequate workspace)
- Guardrails on all platforms and roof edges
- Adequate lighting

**Confined Space Elimination:**
- All plant in open, accessible locations (not cramped ceiling spaces)
- Ventilation openings for natural air flow

**Information Provided:**
- Roof layout showing walkways and platforms
- Anchor point locations for equipment lifting
- Maintenance access procedures

### Example 3: Warehouse Design

**Hazards:** Falls, manual handling, forklift risks.

**Design Solutions:**

**Structure:**
- Adequate floor strength for racking loads
- Wide aisles (3m minimum for forklift operation)
- Level floor (reduces manual handling strain, safer for forklifts)

**Loading Docks:**
- Recessed loading dock (level with truck bed, eliminates step)
- Dock levelers for height adjustment
- Guardrails at edges
- Wheel stops

**Racking:**
- Specify racking design loads clearly
- Adequate aisle widths for safe forklift use
- Loading height within ergonomic reach zones

**Lighting:**
- Adequate lighting for forklift operation (150 lux minimum)
- Emergency lighting for safe evacuation

**Information Provided:**
- Floor load capacity documentation
- Racking installation requirements
- Safe forklift operating procedures

## Benefits of Safe Design

**For All Stakeholders:**

**Fewer Injuries:**
- Eliminates hazards at source (most effective control)
- Protects workers throughout structure lifecycle

**Lower Costs:**
- Reduces incidents (workers compensation, project delays)
- Minimizes expensive retrofits to address WHS issues
- Lower maintenance costs (safer access = faster, cheaper maintenance)

**Legal Compliance:**
- Meets designer duties under WHS Act
- Reduces liability risks

**Better Quality:**
- Integrated approach produces better outcomes
- Considers whole lifecycle, not just initial construction

## Common Design Hazards to Address

**Falls:**
- Work at heights during construction
- Roof access for maintenance
- Window cleaning

**Manual Handling:**
- Heavy materials
- Awkward lifts during construction

**Confined Spaces:**
- Services in ceiling voids
- Tanks, vessels

**Structural Stability:**
- During construction (temporary works)
- Demolition sequence

**Hazardous Materials:**
- Specify non-hazardous alternatives
- Document unavoidable hazardous materials
