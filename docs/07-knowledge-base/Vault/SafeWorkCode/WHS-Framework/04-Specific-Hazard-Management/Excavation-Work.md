# Excavation Work

## What is Excavation Work?

Excavation means removing soil or rock using tools, machinery or explosives to form open trenches, holes or cavities.

**Common Construction Excavations:**
- Trenches for footings, services, drainage
- Bulk excavation for basements, cut-and-fill
- Service pits
- Bored piles

## When is Excavation High-Risk Construction Work?

Excavation is HRCW requiring [[SWMS|SWMS]] if:
- Depth > **1.5 meters**, OR
- Risk of person falling in (any depth)

## Major Hazards

**Collapse of Excavation Walls:**
Most serious risk - can bury and kill workers instantly.

**Underground Services:**
Striking gas, electricity, water, telecommunications.

**Falls into Excavation:**
Workers or public falling in.

**Mobile Plant:**
Excavators, trucks reversing near excavation edge.

**Asphyxiation/Toxic Atmosphere:**
Deep excavations may have oxygen deficiency or toxic gases.

## Before Excavating - Service Location

> [!warning] Always Dial Before You Dig
> Striking underground services causes deaths, serious injuries, major disruptions. Service location is mandatory.

**Process:**

**1. Dial Before You Dig (1100):**
- Call at least 2 business days before excavating
- Obtain plans showing underground services
- Free service

**2. Locate Services on Ground:**
- Use plans and cable/pipe locators
- Mark position with paint or pegs
- Assume all services are live and pressurized

**3. Hand Dig to Expose:**
- Within 500mm of marked services, hand dig only
- Use spades/shovels (not picks or mattocks)
- Carefully expose services
- Confirm type, depth, condition

**4. Protect Exposed Services:**
- Support services crossing excavation
- Protect from damage
- Maintain clearances
- Backfill properly when complete

## Preventing Excavation Collapse

### Assessing Collapse Risk

**Factors Affecting Stability:**
- Soil type (clay more stable than sand)
- Moisture content (wet soil less stable)
- Depth
- Nearby loads (plant, stockpiles, traffic)
- Vibration
- Previous excavation/disturbance

**When is Shoring/Battering Required?**
- **Always for excavations >1.5m in unstable soil**
- Any excavation where collapse risk exists
- Competent person assesses stability

### Control Measures

**Level 1: Elimination**
- Avoid excavation (alternative construction methods)
- Trenchless technology (pipe bursting, boring)

**Level 2: Engineering Controls**

**Battering (Sloping Walls):**
- Cut walls at safe angle (typically 1:1 or flatter)
- Depends on soil type
- Requires more space
- Most reliable for short-duration work

**Shoring:**
- Hydraulic/mechanical supports hold walls
- Allows vertical walls (less space)
- Must be designed by competent person
- Installed progressively as excavation deepens
- Removed carefully during backfilling

**Benching:**
- Step excavation in stable soil
- Reduces wall height
- May combine with battering

**Level 3: Administrative/PPE**
- Exclusion zones
- Barricades/barriers
- Warning signs
- Competent supervision
- SWMS
- PPE (hard hats, boots, hi-vis)

### Inspection

**Daily Inspection Required:**
- Check for cracks, subsidence
- Check supports tight and secure
- After rain, vibration, ground movement
- By competent person

## Safe Access and Egress

**Requirements:**
- Ladder or ramp within **15 meters** of any worker
- Ladder secured, extends 1m above excavation
- Clear path to access point

**Deep Excavations:**
Multiple access points may be needed.

## Edge Protection

**Falls into Excavation:**
- Barriers minimum 1m from edge (prevents collapse and falls)
- Guardrails if excavation remains open
- Covers over narrow trenches (must support traffic loads)
- Adequate lighting
- Warning signs

**Exclusion Zones:**
Keep plant and vehicles back from edge (minimum 1.5 times excavation depth).

## Stockpiles and Spoil

- Minimum 1.5m from excavation edge (prevents surcharge loading)
- Consider wall stability when placing
- Do not undercut stockpiles

## Confined Space Considerations

**Deep Excavations May Be Confined Spaces:**
- Limited entry/exit
- Unfavorable atmosphere
- Not designed for continuous occupancy

**When Confined Space:**
Apply [[Confined-Spaces|confined space]] requirements:
- Atmospheric testing
- Ventilation
- Entry permits
- Rescue procedures

## Dewatering

**Water in Excavation:**
- Destabilizes walls
- Slip/drowning hazard

**Controls:**
- Pump out water
- Cut off water source
- May require engineered dewatering system
- Monitor wall stability (water removal can cause collapse)

## Practical Example

**Scenario:** Excavating trench for sewer line (2m deep, 50m long)

**Before Excavating:**
1. Dial Before You Dig - plans obtained
2. Services marked (water main, electricity, telecommunications)
3. Cable locator confirms positions
4. Hand dig trial holes - services exposed and confirmed
5. SWMS prepared

**During Excavation:**
- Excavator maintains 500mm clearance from services
- Hand dig close to services
- Walls battered 1:1 (stable clay soil)
- Ladder every 15m
- Barriers 1.5m from edges
- Daily inspections before work

**Result:** Excavation completed safely, no service strikes, no collapses.
