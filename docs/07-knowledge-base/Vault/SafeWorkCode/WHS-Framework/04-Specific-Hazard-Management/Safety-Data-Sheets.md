# Safety Data Sheets (SDS)

## What is a Safety Data Sheet?

A Safety Data Sheet (SDS) is a document that provides comprehensive information about a hazardous chemical, including:
- Chemical identification and hazards
- Safe handling and storage
- Emergency procedures
- Exposure controls and PPE requirements

**Former Name:** Material Safety Data Sheet (MSDS) - now superseded by SDS under GHS.

## Who Must Prepare SDS?

**Manufacturers and importers** of hazardous chemicals must prepare SDS before first supply.

**Suppliers** must provide current SDS with first supply and when SDS updated.

## When is SDS Required?

SDS required for all hazardous chemicals supplied for use in workplaces.

**Exception:** Consumer products in original packaging (if same as retail).

## SDS Format - 16 Sections (GHS)

SDS must follow standardized 16-section format:

**Section 1: Identification**
- Product identifier (chemical name)
- Manufacturer/supplier details
- Recommended uses
- Emergency contact number

**Section 2: Hazard Identification**
- GHS classification (health, physical, environmental hazards)
- Signal word (Danger or Warning)
- Hazard statements
- Precautionary statements
- Pictograms

**Section 3: Composition/Information on Ingredients**
- Chemical identity of ingredients
- Concentration ranges
- CAS numbers

**Section 4: First Aid Measures**
- Symptoms of exposure
- First aid by exposure route (inhalation, skin, eyes, ingestion)
- Medical attention requirements

**Section 5: Fire-Fighting Measures**
- Suitable extinguishing media
- Unsuitable extinguishing media
- Specific hazards (toxic fumes, etc.)
- Special firefighting equipment

**Section 6: Accidental Release Measures**
- Personal precautions
- Environmental precautions
- Containment and cleanup methods

**Section 7: Handling and Storage**
- Safe handling precautions
- Conditions for safe storage
- Incompatible materials

**Section 8: Exposure Controls/Personal Protection**
- **Exposure standards** (workplace exposure limits)
- Engineering controls (ventilation, etc.)
- PPE (respiratory, eye, hand, skin protection)

**Section 9: Physical and Chemical Properties**
- Appearance, odor
- pH, melting/boiling point
- Flammability, vapor pressure
- Other physical data

**Section 10: Stability and Reactivity**
- Chemical stability
- Possible hazardous reactions
- Conditions to avoid
- Incompatible materials
- Hazardous decomposition products

**Section 11: Toxicological Information**
- Routes of exposure
- Acute and chronic health effects
- Numerical toxicity data (LD50, LC50)

**Section 12: Ecological Information**
- Environmental fate
- Aquatic/terrestrial toxicity
- Persistence and degradability

**Section 13: Disposal Considerations**
- Waste disposal methods
- Regulatory requirements

**Section 14: Transport Information**
- UN number
- Proper shipping name
- Transport hazard class
- Packing group

**Section 15: Regulatory Information**
- Australian regulatory information
- Poisons schedule (if applicable)

**Section 16: Other Information**
- Date of preparation/revision
- Key to abbreviations
- Disclaimer

## Using SDS

### Before Using Chemical

**Read SDS to understand:**
- What hazards does it present?
- How should it be stored?
- What controls are needed?
- What PPE is required?
- What to do in emergency (spill, exposure, fire)?

### During Risk Assessment

**SDS provides:**
- Hazard identification (Section 2)
- Exposure standards (Section 8)
- Information to select controls (Sections 7, 8)

### For Emergency Response

**SDS specifies:**
- First aid (Section 4)
- Fire-fighting (Section 5)
- Spill response (Section 6)

### Training Workers

Use SDS to:
- Explain hazards
- Demonstrate safe handling
- Show proper PPE use
- Practice emergency procedures

## PCBU Duties

### Obtain SDS

**Must obtain SDS:**
- Before using hazardous chemical for first time
- When SDS updated by supplier

**How to obtain:**
- Request from supplier (supplier must provide)
- Download from manufacturer website

### Make SDS Accessible

**Must ensure:**
- SDS readily accessible to all workers using the chemical
- Available during work hours
- Available to emergency responders

**Methods:**
- Hard copy register (binder, filing cabinet)
- Electronic system (computer, tablet)
- Combination

**Location:**
- Near where chemical used/stored
- Portable for remote work

### Keep SDS Current

**Update when:**
- Supplier provides revised SDS (within 5 years minimum)
- Chemical formulation changes
- New hazard information available

**Review:**
- Check SDS date (Section 16)
- Contact supplier for updates if SDS >5 years old

## What if SDS Not Provided?

**If supplier fails to provide SDS:**
- Request in writing
- Do not use chemical until SDS obtained
- Report to SafeWork NSW if supplier refuses

**Never use unlabeled or undocumented chemicals.**

## SDS vs Label

**SDS:**
- Comprehensive information (16 sections)
- Detailed safety data
- Used for risk assessment, training, emergencies

**Label:**
- Summary information
- On chemical container
- Quick reference for users

Both required - they complement each other.

See [[Labelling-Requirements|Labelling of Hazardous Chemicals]].

## Practical Construction Example

**Chemical:** Two-pack epoxy floor coating

**Before Use:**

**Read SDS:**
- **Section 2:** Hazards identified - skin sensitizer, flammable vapors, harmful if inhaled
- **Section 7:** Store in cool, well-ventilated area, keep away from ignition sources
- **Section 8:** Exposure standard for vapors, requires ventilation, PPE: nitrile gloves, organic vapor respirator, safety glasses
- **Section 5:** Use CO₂ or dry chemical extinguisher (not water)

**Risk Assessment:**
- High risk: Skin contact (sensitization), vapor inhalation
- Controls needed: Ventilation, PPE, fire safety

**Controls Implemented:**
- Forced ventilation in enclosed area
- Nitrile gloves (epoxy-resistant)
- Fitted organic vapor respirators
- Safety glasses
- Fire extinguisher (dry chemical) on-site
- No hot work permitted

**Training:**
- Workers shown SDS
- Explained sensitization risk (avoid skin contact)
- Demonstrated proper glove removal
- Practiced respirator fit check

**Emergency Prep:**
- First aid for skin contact: Remove with waterless cleaner, wash with soap and water (Section 4)
- Spill kit available (absorbent pads, waste bags - Section 6)
- Emergency contact number programmed in phone

**SDS Location:**
- Copy in site supervisor's vehicle
- Electronic copy on tablet
- Copy displayed in work area
