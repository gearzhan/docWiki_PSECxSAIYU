# Confined Spaces

## What is a Confined Space?

A confined space is an enclosed or partially enclosed space that:
- Is not designed or intended for continuous human occupancy, AND
- Has one or more of these characteristics:
  - Limited entry/exit
  - Unfavorable natural ventilation
  - Risk of harmful atmosphere
  - Risk of engulfment

**Common Construction Confined Spaces:**
- Trenches/excavations (>1.5m deep)
- Tanks, vessels, silos
- Pits, sumps, wells
- Sewers, drains, culverts
- Roof spaces with limited access
- Tunnels and shafts
- Bins and hoppers

> [!warning] Confined Space Deaths
> Confined spaces kill workers quickly. Most deaths occur during attempted rescues by untrained persons.

## Major Hazards

### Atmospheric Hazards

**Oxygen Deficiency:**
- Normal oxygen: 20.9%
- Safe working level: 19.5-23%
- < 19.5%: Drowsiness, unconsciousness, death
- Causes: Consumption by chemical processes, displacement by other gases

**Toxic Gases:**
- Carbon monoxide (CO) - colorless, odorless, deadly
- Hydrogen sulfide (H₂S) - "rotten egg" smell, toxic
- Sewer gases, chemical vapors

**Flammable Atmospheres:**
- Methane, LPG, solvents
- Risk of fire/explosion

**Toxic Dusts/Fumes:**
- Welding fumes in enclosed spaces
- Dust accumulation

### Physical Hazards

**Engulfment:**
- Burial by grain, sand, liquids
- Can occur rapidly

**Entrapment:**
- Limited escape routes
- Difficult rescue access

**Temperature Extremes:**
- Heat stress in hot confined spaces
- Hypothermia in cold/wet spaces

**Other:**
- Noise, slips/trips, falling objects
- Mechanical equipment

## Identifying Confined Spaces

**Risk Assessment Required:**
Assess each space before entry to determine if it's a confined space.

**Consider:**
- Is it enclosed/partially enclosed?
- How many entry/exit points?
- How quickly could atmosphere become hazardous?
- What work will be done inside (might create hazards)?
- Has space contained hazardous substances?

## When is Confined Space Entry HRCW?

Work in/near confined space is HRCW requiring [[SWMS|SWMS]].

## Managing Confined Space Risks

### Hierarchy of Control

**Level 1: Elimination**

**Eliminate need to enter:**
- Remote inspection (cameras, drones)
- Automation/robotics
- Design changes

**Example:** Install tank with external manholes for cleaning instead of requiring internal entry.

**Level 2: Minimize Risks if Entry Required**

**Engineering Controls:**

**Ventilation:**
- Forced ventilation to maintain safe atmosphere
- Fresh air supply
- Continuous operation during entry

**Isolation:**
- Isolate from energy sources (electrical, mechanical, hydraulic)
- Lockout/tagout
- Blank off pipes (prevent ingress of substances)
- Drainage to prevent flooding

**Atmospheric Monitoring:**
- Continuous monitoring during entry
- Test for oxygen, flammable gases, toxic gases
- Calibrated instruments
- Alarms if atmosphere unsafe

**Access/Egress:**
- Improve access points where possible
- Ensure rescue equipment can be used

**Level 3: Administrative/PPE**

**Entry Permits:**
- Written authority to enter
- Confirms controls in place
- Authorizer signs permit

**Training:**
- Confined space awareness
- Emergency procedures
- Equipment use

**Standby Person:**
- Remains outside
- Maintains communication
- Raises alarm if needed
- Does not enter for rescue

**Respiratory Protection:**
- Supplied-air respirators (continuous fresh air)
- Self-contained breathing apparatus (SCBA) for IDLH atmospheres
- NOT air-purifying respirators in oxygen-deficient spaces

**Other PPE:**
- Full-body harness with retrieval line
- Hard hat, gloves, boots
- Protective clothing

## Atmospheric Testing

**Before Entry:**
- Test atmosphere from outside
- Test top, middle, bottom (gases stratify)
- Only enter if safe

**During Entry:**
- Continuous monitoring
- Alarm if atmosphere changes
- Exit immediately if unsafe

**Testing For:**
- **Oxygen:** 19.5-23% safe
- **Flammable gases:** <5% of lower explosive limit (LEL)
- **Toxic gases:** Below exposure standards (CO, H₂S, etc.)

**Equipment:**
- Multi-gas detector (O₂, LEL, CO, H₂S minimum)
- Calibrated and bump-tested
- Alarms set correctly

## Entry Permits

**Permit Must Specify:**
- Location and description of space
- Purpose of entry
- Duration of entry
- Names of entrants, standby person, supervisor
- Hazards identified
- Control measures required
- Atmospheric test results
- Emergency contact numbers
- Authorizer signature

**Before Entry:**
- All control measures verified in place
- All personnel briefed
- Permit signed

**During Entry:**
- Permit displayed at entry point
- Valid for specified duration only
- Cancelled if conditions change

## Emergency Response and Rescue

> [!warning] Never Enter for Rescue
> Untrained, unequipped rescue attempts kill more people than the original incident. DO NOT ENTER.

**Requirements:**

**Rescue Plan:**
- Specific to confined space
- Method to retrieve without entry (preferred)
- Rescue equipment identified
- Trained rescue personnel or emergency services
- Regular drills

**Retrieval Equipment:**
- Full-body harness on entrant
- Retrieval line attached
- Mechanical retrieval winch (can lift unconscious person)
- Available for immediate use

**Communication:**
- Constant communication between entrant and standby person
- Method: visual, verbal, radio, rope signals
- Standby person raises alarm immediately if communication lost

**If Emergency:**
1. Standby person raises alarm
2. Calls emergency services (000)
3. Attempts non-entry rescue if safe (use retrieval line/winch)
4. Does NOT enter confined space
5. Provides information to emergency responders

## Practical Example

**Scenario:** Inspecting inside concrete water tank (empty, 3m deep)

### Before Entry

**Identify:** Confirmed confined space (enclosed, limited exit, unfavorable ventilation)

**Assess Hazards:**
- Oxygen deficiency (enclosed space)
- Slip hazard (wet surfaces)
- Limited access (single manhole 600mm diameter)

**Controls Implemented:**

**Engineering:**
- Forced ventilation (blower supplying fresh air)
- Continuous atmospheric monitoring (O₂, LEL, CO)
- Tank isolated (valves locked shut, tagged)
- Lighting installed

**Administrative:**
- Entry permit prepared and authorized
- Entrant and standby person briefed
- Emergency services notified (on standby)

**PPE:**
- Full-body harness with retrieval line
- Supplied-air respirator (continuous fresh air supply)
- Hard hat, gloves, non-slip boots

### During Entry

- Atmospheric test: O₂ 20.8%, LEL 0%, CO 0 ppm ✓
- Standby person positioned at entry
- Communication maintained (verbal through manhole)
- Continuous monitoring (alarm if atmosphere changes)
- Inspection completed in 20 minutes
- Entrant exits safely

### Result
Safe entry and exit. Continuous monitoring and standby person provided safety net.
