# Managing Electrical Risks

## Electrical Hazards

Electricity is essential on construction sites but presents serious hazards:

**Electric Shock:**
- Current passes through body
- Can cause death, severe burns, falls from height
- Low voltages (< 50V AC/120V DC) generally safe, but not always
- 230V AC (standard power) can kill

**Arc Flash and Burns:**
- Electrical faults create intense heat and light
- Severe burns, eye damage, ignition of materials

**Fire and Explosion:**
- Faulty wiring, overloaded circuits
- Ignition of flammable materials/atmospheres

**Secondary Injuries:**
- Falls from height after shock
- Injuries from muscle contractions

> [!warning] Fatal Risk
> Electricity kills quickly. Even brief contact with live parts can cause cardiac arrest.

## Who Has Duties?

### PCBUs

Must:
- Ensure electrical equipment safe
- Maintain electrical installations
- Use licensed electrical workers for electrical work
- Provide RCDs (residual current devices)
- Test and tag equipment
- Manage risks from overhead/underground electrical services

### Licensed Electrical Workers

Only licensed electricians may perform electrical work (installation, alteration, maintenance, repair of electrical equipment).

**Exceptions** (general workers may perform):
- Replacing lamps, fuses
- Plugging/unplugging equipment
- Resetting RCDs or circuit breakers

## Risk Management Process

### 1. Identify Hazards

**Construction Site Electrical Hazards:**
- Overhead powerlines
- Underground cables
- Temporary site wiring
- Damaged cables and equipment
- Wet conditions
- Metal scaffolding near electrical sources
- Inadequate RCD protection

### 2. Assess Risks

**Higher Risk Situations:**
- Contact with overhead powerlines (cranes, EWPs, scaffolding, long materials)
- Excavation near underground cables
- Wet/damp environments
- Use of metal ladders or scaffolding
- Damaged or poorly maintained equipment

### 3. Control Risks: Hierarchy of Control

**Level 1: Elimination**

- Eliminate need for electrical equipment (use battery/pneumatic tools)
- De-energize powerlines before work near them

**Example:** Request electrical utility to isolate and earth overhead lines before crane operation.

**Level 2: Substitution/Engineering**

**Isolation and Earthing:**
- De-energize electrical equipment before work
- Lockout/tagout procedures
- Earthing of de-energized systems

**Insulation:**
- Insulated cables and equipment
- Insulation barriers around live parts
- Insulated tools for electrical work

**Residual Current Devices (RCDs):**
- Detects leakage current, disconnects power instantly
- **Mandatory for construction sites** (WHS Reg 164)
- 30 mA maximum for socket outlets supplying equipment
- 10 mA for portable RCDs used outdoors/wet areas

**Double Insulation:**
- Equipment with extra layer of insulation
- Marked with double square symbol
- Reduces shock risk

**Extra-Low Voltage (ELV):**
- Systems ≤50V AC or ≤120V DC
- Reduced risk of electric shock
- Example: 12V or 24V power tools

**Physical Barriers:**
- Guards around switchboards, junction boxes
- Fencing/barricades around substations
- Covers over floor boxes

**Level 3: Administrative/PPE**

- Safe work procedures
- Electrical safety training
- Permit systems for work near live parts
- Exclusion zones around overhead powerlines
- PPE (insulated gloves, dielectric footwear) - for electrical workers only

### 4. Maintain and Review

- Regular testing and inspection
- Test and tag portable equipment
- RCD testing (push test button monthly, full test every 6 months)
- Replace damaged cables immediately

## RCDs (Safety Switches)

**How RCDs Work:**
Monitors current flow. If imbalance detected (leakage to ground through person), disconnects power within 30 milliseconds.

**Requirements for Construction:**
- RCD protection for all socket outlets supplying portable equipment
- Portable RCDs if fixed RCDs not available
- Test before each day's use (push test button)

> [!important] RCDs Save Lives
> RCDs are the primary protection against electric shock on construction sites. Never bypass or disable.

## Overhead Powerlines

**Extreme Risk:** Contact with overhead powerlines causes many construction fatalities.

**Affected Activities:**
- Crane operations
- Elevated work platforms
- Scaffolding erection
- Carrying long materials (pipes, ladders, formwork)
- Tipping trucks (raised bodies)
- Tree work

### Safe Approach Distances

**For voltages ≤132,000V:**
- Non-electrical workers: **Minimum 3 meters**
- Licensed electrical workers: Refer to AS/NZS 4836

**For voltages >132,000V:**
- Greater distances apply - check with electrical authority

> [!warning] Increased Distances for Equipment
> When operating plant, increase distance to 6 meters or more. Account for boom swing, load sway, vehicle movement.

### Control Measures

**Preferred (Level 1):**
- **De-energize and earth powerlines** for duration of work

**If De-Energization Not Practicable:**
- Install physical barriers (goal posts, height markers)
- Appoint spotter to watch clearances
- Use insulated/non-conductive equipment
- Establish exclusion zones
- Continuous communication between spotter and operator

**Example:** Crane work near powerlines - Request utility to de-energize lines, or install goal post barriers and appoint dedicated spotter.

## Underground Cables

**Risk:** Striking underground cables during excavation causes electrocution, burns, explosions.

**Before Excavating:**

1. **Dial Before You Dig** (1100) - Obtain service location plans
2. **Locate services** on ground (use plans, cable locators)
3. **Mark services** clearly (paint, pegs)
4. **Expose services** carefully (hand dig within 500mm)
5. **Inspect services** (confirm type, depth, condition)
6. **Support and protect** services during work

> [!important] Always Dial Before You Dig
> Free service provides plans showing underground services. Call 1100 at least 2 business days before excavating.

### Safe Excavation Procedure

- **No mechanical excavation within 500mm** of marked services
- Hand tools only (spades, shovels - not picks or mattocks)
- Assume unidentified cables are live
- Locate all services even if only one type expected
- Support services crossing trenches
- Restore covers before backfilling

## Temporary Site Wiring

**Installation:**
- Licensed electrician only
- Adequate capacity for loads
- Protected from damage (elevated or buried)
- RCD protection on all socket outlets

**Cables:**
- Heavy-duty flexible cables (not domestic cable)
- Supported off ground where practical
- Protected from traffic, plant, sharp edges
- No joins in cables (use correct length)

**Switchboards:**
- Weather-protected enclosures
- Secured to prevent movement
- RCDs installed and labeled
- Accessible for testing/maintenance

## Test and Tag

Portable electrical equipment must be regularly tested and tagged:

**Visual Inspection:**
- Damage to cables, plugs, casing
- Strain relief intact
- Correct rating for use

**Electrical Testing:**
- Earth continuity
- Insulation resistance
- RCD function (if built-in)
- Conducted by competent person

**Testing Frequency:**
- Construction sites: **Every 3 months** (high-risk environment)
- Other workplaces: 6-12 months depending on environment

**Tagging:**
- Tag shows test date, next test due, tester details
- Do not use untagged equipment

## Wet Conditions

**Increased Risk:**
Water conducts electricity - wet conditions greatly increase shock risk.

**Controls:**
- Keep equipment dry (covers, shelters)
- Use waterproof equipment rated for wet use (IP rating)
- Use 10mA portable RCDs
- Extra-low voltage tools (12V/24V)
- Delay work until conditions dry where possible

## Damaged Equipment

**Never use damaged electrical equipment:**
- Frayed or cut cables
- Broken plugs or sockets
- Cracked casings
- Damaged switches

**Action:**
- Tag as defective ("DO NOT USE")
- Remove from service
- Arrange repair by electrician or disposal

## Practical Construction Example

**Scenario:** Installing steel formwork near 11kV overhead powerlines

### Hazards Identified
- Formwork panels 3.6m long (unwieldy)
- Overhead powerlines 5m above ground
- Risk of contact during lifting/placing
- Metal formwork conducts electricity

### Risk Assessment
- Extreme risk: Powerline contact = electrocution, arc flash

### Controls Implemented

**Engineering (Level 1):**
- **Powerlines de-energized** by electrical utility for 4-hour work period
- Isolation confirmed and earthed

**Administrative:**
- Permit to work issued by utility
- Work scheduled within de-energized period
- All workers briefed on powerline location
- Spotter assigned to monitor work area

**If De-energization Not Available:**
Would implement:
- Goal post barriers at 6m from powerlines
- Spotter with authority to stop work
- Pre-assembled formwork on ground to minimize lifting near lines
- Exclusion zone barricaded

### Result
Work completed safely with powerlines de-energized. Zero risk of electrical contact.

## Information and Training

Workers must know:
- Risks of electricity
- How to identify electrical hazards
- Importance of RCDs and how to test
- Not to use damaged equipment
- Overhead and underground powerline risks
- Who to contact if electrical issues arise
- Emergency response to electric shock

## Emergency Response - Electric Shock

**If someone receives electric shock:**

1. **Do not touch** the person if still in contact with electricity
2. **Turn off power** at switchboard if safe to do so
3. **Call 000** immediately
4. If power cannot be turned off, use non-conductive material (dry wood) to separate person from source
5. Begin CPR if trained and person not breathing
6. Continue until ambulance arrives

> [!warning] Do Not Touch
> Do not become a second victim. Never touch someone in contact with electricity until power disconnected.
