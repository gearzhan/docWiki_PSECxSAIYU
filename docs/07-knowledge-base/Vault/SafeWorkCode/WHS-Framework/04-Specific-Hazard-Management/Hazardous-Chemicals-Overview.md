# Hazardous Chemicals Overview

## What are Hazardous Chemicals?

Hazardous chemicals are substances, mixtures and articles that are classified as hazardous under the Globally Harmonized System of Classification and Labelling of Chemicals (GHS). These include chemicals that pose health hazards (toxic, corrosive, carcinogenic) or physical hazards (flammable, explosive, oxidizing).

**Common Construction Examples:**
- Solvents, paints, adhesives, thinners
- Cleaning agents and degreasers
- Fuels (diesel, petrol, LPG)
- Concrete additives and curing compounds
- Welding gases and fumes
- Epoxy resins and hardeners

> [!important] Legal Requirement
> PCBUs must manage risks from hazardous chemicals by following the [[_Risk-Management-Overview|four-step risk management process]]: identify, assess, control, and review.

## Who Has Duties?

### PCBUs Using Hazardous Chemicals

Must:
- Identify which chemicals are hazardous
- Maintain a register of hazardous chemicals
- Obtain and maintain Safety Data Sheets (SDS)
- Ensure proper labelling
- Assess and control risks
- Provide information, training, and supervision
- Provide health monitoring where required

### Manufacturers, Importers, and Suppliers

Must:
- Classify chemicals according to GHS
- Prepare accurate Safety Data Sheets
- Ensure correct labelling
- Provide updated information

See [[Designers|Supply Chain Duty Holders]] for detailed requirements.

## Identifying Hazardous Chemicals

### Safety Data Sheets (SDS)

The primary source of information about a hazardous chemical. [[Safety-Data-Sheets|Safety Data Sheets]] must:
- Follow 16-section GHS format
- Identify hazards and classifications
- Describe safe handling and storage
- Specify emergency procedures
- List exposure standards where applicable

**When Required:**
Manufacturers and suppliers must provide an SDS for all hazardous chemicals supplied for use in a workplace.

### Labels

All hazardous chemical containers must have [[Labelling-Requirements|labels]] showing:
- Product identifier (chemical name)
- Hazard pictograms (GHS symbols)
- Signal words (Danger or Warning)
- Hazard statements
- Precautionary statements
- Supplier identification

> [!warning] Never Use Unlabelled Chemicals
> If a container is not labelled or the label is damaged, do not use the chemical until proper identification and labelling is restored.

## Register of Hazardous Chemicals

PCBUs must maintain a current register listing:
- Product name
- Manufacturer/supplier details
- Where the chemical is stored/used
- Quantity kept on site
- Date of last SDS review

The register must be:
- Readily accessible to workers
- Kept up to date
- Available to health and safety representatives

**Construction Site Requirement:**
Include chemicals brought on site by subcontractors.

## Risk Management Process

### 1. Identify Hazards

Determine which chemicals are hazardous by:
- Checking labels and SDS
- Reviewing manufacturer information
- Considering process-generated hazards (welding fumes, concrete dust)

### 2. Assess Risks

Consider:
- **Health hazards**: Toxicity, corrosivity, sensitization, carcinogenicity
- **Physical hazards**: Flammability, explosiveness, reactivity
- **Exposure**: How much, how often, for how long
- **Who is at risk**: Workers, visitors, public

### 3. Control Risks

Apply the [[Step-3-Control-Risks|Hierarchy of Control]]:

**Level 1: Elimination**
- Modify process to not require the hazardous chemical
- Example: Use mechanical cleaning instead of chemical solvents

**Level 2: Substitution**
- Replace with less hazardous alternative
- Example: Water-based paint instead of solvent-based

**Level 2: Isolation**
- Separate workers from chemical
- Example: Enclosed mixing systems, remote handling

**Level 2: Engineering Controls**
- Local exhaust ventilation (LEV)
- Fume extraction at source
- Enclosed processes

**Level 3: Administrative Controls**
- Safe work procedures
- Training and supervision
- Exposure time limits
- Good housekeeping

**Level 3: PPE**
- Gloves (chemical-resistant, correct type)
- Eye protection (safety glasses, goggles, face shields)
- Respiratory protection (fitted, appropriate for chemical)
- Protective clothing

> [!tip] Multiple Controls Required
> For hazardous chemicals, typically multiple control measures from different levels work together to achieve safe exposure levels.

### 4. Maintain and Review

- Inspect and maintain ventilation systems
- Replace contaminated PPE
- Review after incidents or near-misses
- Update when chemicals change or new information available

## Exposure Standards

Exposure standards specify the maximum airborne concentration of a chemical that workers may be exposed to over time.

**Time-Weighted Average (TWA):**
Average exposure over 8-hour work day

**Short-Term Exposure Limit (STEL):**
Average exposure over 15-minute period

> [!important] Monitoring Required
> If uncertain whether exposure exceeds standards, air monitoring must be conducted by a competent person.

When exposure standard exists:
- Control measures must ensure exposure remains below the standard
- Air monitoring may be required to verify compliance
- [[Health-Monitoring-Overview|Health monitoring]] required for certain chemicals (Schedule 14)

## Specific Chemical Hazards

### Flammable and Combustible Liquids

**Control Measures:**
- Store in approved flammable liquid cabinets
- Keep ignition sources away
- Provide fire extinguishers
- Bond and ground containers during transfer
- Control vapour accumulation with ventilation

**Construction Example:**
Paint storage area must have ventilation, fire extinguishers, no smoking signs, and be away from ignition sources.

### Corrosive Substances

**Hazards:**
Cause severe burns to skin, eyes, respiratory tract

**Control Measures:**
- Store separately from incompatible chemicals
- Use chemical-resistant containers and equipment
- Provide emergency eyewash and shower
- Use appropriate PPE (face shields, aprons, gloves)

### Toxic Chemicals

**Hazards:**
May cause acute poisoning or chronic health effects

**Control Measures:**
- Minimize quantities kept on site
- Ventilation to prevent vapor buildup
- Fitted respiratory protection where required
- Health monitoring for certain substances

## Storage and Handling

### Safe Storage Principles

**Segregation:**
Separate incompatible chemicals (acids from bases, oxidizers from fuels)

**Containment:**
- Bunding to contain spills
- Secondary containment for liquid storage
- Secure storage to prevent unauthorized access

**Signage:**
- Manifest quantities require placarding
- Emergency service information
- Hazard warnings

### Spill Response

Must have:
- Spill kits appropriate to chemicals used
- Trained personnel to respond
- Emergency procedures documented
- Contaminated material disposal procedures

## Information and Training

Workers must be provided:
- Information on hazards of chemicals they work with
- How to safely use, handle, and store chemicals
- How to use control measures (ventilation, PPE)
- Emergency procedures including spill response
- Location and interpretation of SDS

> [!tip] Induction Requirement
> Construction sites must include chemical safety in site induction, covering location of SDS register, spill response, and PPE requirements.

## Health Monitoring

Required for workers exposed to certain chemicals listed in Schedule 14, including:
- Isocyanates (polyurethane products)
- Lead and lead compounds
- Mercury and compounds
- Certain organic solvents

See [[Health-Monitoring-Overview|Health Monitoring]] for detailed requirements.

## Emergency Preparedness

Emergency plans must address:
- Chemical spills and releases
- Fire involving hazardous chemicals
- Exposure incidents (inhalation, skin contact, ingestion)
- First aid and medical treatment
- Emergency service notification

**Emergency Equipment:**
- Appropriate fire extinguishers for chemicals present
- Spill kits and absorbents
- Emergency eyewash stations (where corrosives used)
- Safety showers (for large-scale corrosive exposure risk)

## Practical Construction Example

### Hazards Identified
- Epoxy resin and hardener are skin sensitizers
- Solvent vapors are flammable and harmful
- Confined space may accumulate vapors

### Risk Assessment
- High risk: Fire/explosion from vapor accumulation
- High risk: Respiratory exposure to vapors
- Medium risk: Skin sensitization from direct contact

### Controls Implemented

**Elimination/Substitution:**
- Not reasonably practicable (epoxy coating specified)

**Engineering:**
- Forced ventilation to extract vapors
- Open doors/windows for cross-ventilation
- Mix materials outdoors where possible

**Administrative:**
- Safe work method statement prepared
- Trained applicators only
- Work during cooler hours to reduce vapor release
- Hot work permit system for ignition sources

**PPE:**
- Nitrile gloves (epoxy-resistant)
- Organic vapor respirators (fitted)
