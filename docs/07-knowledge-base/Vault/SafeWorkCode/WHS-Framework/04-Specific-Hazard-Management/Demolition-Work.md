# Demolition Work

## What is Demolition Work?

Demolition work means work to demolish or dismantle a structure, or part of a structure. This includes:
- Complete building demolition
- Partial demolition/strip-out
- Structural alterations
- Dismantling plant or structures

## Demolition is Always High-Risk Construction Work

All demolition work requires [[SWMS|Safe Work Method Statement]], regardless of height or size.

## Major Hazards

**Structural Collapse:**
- Uncontrolled or premature collapse
- Workers trapped/crushed

**Asbestos:**
- Most buildings pre-2004 contain asbestos
- Disturbing asbestos releases deadly fibers

**Falls from Height:**
- Working on structures being demolished
- Floor/roof collapse

**Underground Services:**
- Striking gas, electricity, water during demolition

**Falling Objects/Materials:**
- Materials falling on workers or public below
- Debris ejected during demolition

**Hazardous Substances:**
- Lead paint, chemical residues
- Dust (silica, general)

**Plant and Equipment:**
- Excavators with hammers/shears
- Elevated work platforms
- Cranes

## Before Demolition - Mandatory Requirements

### 1. Asbestos Assessment (WHS Reg 443)

> [!warning] Never Demolish Without Asbestos Check
> Failure to identify asbestos before demolition is prohibited and extremely dangerous.

**Requirements:**
- Obtain or prepare asbestos register for structure
- If no register, presume asbestos present OR arrange inspection/sampling
- If asbestos identified, arrange licensed removal BEFORE demolition
- Provide asbestos information to all workers

See [[Asbestos-Overview|Asbestos]] for detailed guidance.

### 2. Structural Engineering Report

**Required for:**
- Structures >3 storeys
- Complex structures
- Where demolition method may affect stability

**Report Must Cover:**
- Structural details and construction method
- Sequence of demolition
- Special precautions required
- Method of preventing premature collapse

### 3. Service Disconnection

**Before Demolition:**
- Disconnect or isolate all services:
  - Electricity (confirm de-energized)
  - Gas (confirmed isolated by supplier)
  - Water
  - Telecommunications
  - Sewerage

**Underground Services:**
- Locate using Dial Before You Dig
- Protect or remove before demolition

### 4. Demolition Plan

**Plan Must Address:**
- Sequence of demolition (what comes down first, last)
- Method (manual, mechanical, explosives)
- Structural stability during demolition
- Control of dust, noise, vibration
- Waste management
- Traffic management
- Protection of public and adjacent properties
- Emergency procedures

## Methods of Demolition

### Manual (Hand) Demolition

**Process:**
- Top-down, piece-by-piece removal
- Hand tools, small power tools

**When Used:**
- Small structures
- Where mechanical methods not suitable
- Hazardous materials present (asbestos)
- Adjacent structures must be protected

**Hazards:**
- Falls from height
- Manual handling
- Dust exposure

### Mechanical Demolition

**Equipment:**
- Excavators with:
  - Hydraulic breakers
  - Pulverizers
  - Shears
- Wrecking balls (rare, high risk)

**When Used:**
- Large structures
- Faster than manual

**Hazards:**
- Structural collapse
- Plant rollover
- Falling materials
- Dust

**Controls:**
- Competent operator
- Safe operating distance
- Exclusion zones
- Water suppression for dust

### Explosive Demolition

**Highly Specialized:**
- Licensed shot firers
- Detailed engineering design
- Large exclusion zones
- Emergency services notification

**Rarely Used:** Except major structures in open areas.

## Sequence of Demolition

**General Principle: Top Down**
- Remove roof first
- Then top floors
- Work down to ground
- Basement last

**Maintain Stability:**
- Remove non-structural elements first (windows, doors, fittings)
- Leave structural supports until last
- May require temporary bracing

**Exceptions:**
- Mechanical demolition may work differently (push over intact)
- Requires engineering assessment

## Control Measures

### Structural Stability

- Follow engineering report
- Install temporary supports if required
- Monitor for unexpected movement/cracking
- Establish exclusion zones (minimum 2 times building height)

### Falls Prevention

- Edge protection on floors being demolished
- Safety mesh under fragile materials
- Scaffolding where needed
- Fall arrest systems (if edge protection not practicable)

See [[Managing-Risk-of-Falls|Falls]].

### Falling Objects

- Barricades and exclusion zones
- Chutes for dropping materials (enclosed)
- Screens on scaffolding
- Warning signs
- Hard hat areas

**Never Drop Materials:**
Use controlled lowering or enclosed chutes.

### Dust Control

- Water suppression (continuous wetting)
- Avoid dry sweeping or dry demolition
- Enclose work areas where practicable
- Respiratory protection for workers

See [[Managing-Risks-of-Respirable-Crystalline-Silica|Silica Dust]].

### Public Protection

- Hoarding/fencing (minimum 1.8m high)
- Gantries/awnings over footpaths
- Traffic management
- Warning signs
- Security (prevent unauthorized entry)

## Waste Management

**Segregate Waste:**
- Asbestos (special disposal)
- Recyclables (concrete, metal, timber)
- General waste
- Hazardous waste (lead paint, chemicals)

**Asbestos Waste:**
See [[Asbestos-Overview|Asbestos]] - requires licensed disposal.

**Dust and Debris:**
- Prevent dust leaving site (water, barriers)
- Clean roads daily
- Cover trucks transporting waste

## Practical Example

**Scenario:** Demolishing 2-storey brick house (built 1970s)

### Pre-Demolition

**1. Asbestos Assessment:**
- Building inspection conducted
- Asbestos identified: roof (fibro cement), eaves, internal walls
- Licensed asbestos removalist engaged
- Asbestos removed (clearance certificate obtained)
- Register updated

**2. Services:**
- Electricity disconnected (verified)
- Gas isolated by supplier
- Water capped
- Underground services located

**3. Demolition Plan:**
- Method: Mechanical (excavator with pulverizer)
- Sequence: Roof, walls, slab, footings
- Dust control: Water sprays
- Exclusion zone: 10m from structure
- Public protection: 1.8m hoarding erected

### During Demolition

**Controls:**
- SWMS reviewed with workers
- Licensed excavator operator
- Water tanker continuously wetting debris
- Exclusion zone barricaded
- Spotter monitoring for hazards
- Hard hats, respirators (P2), hi-vis, boots
- Waste segregated (brick to recycling, timber to bin)

**Sequence:**
1. Non-structural: windows, doors, fixtures removed (manual)
2. Roof sheeting and framing pulled down (excavator)
3. Walls demolished section by section
4. Slab broken up
5. Footings removed
6. Site leveled and cleaned

### Result
Demolition completed in 3 days, no injuries, asbestos safely removed beforehand, dust controlled, waste recycled.
