# Safe Work Method Statements (SWMS)

## What is a SWMS?

A Safe Work Method Statement (SWMS) is a document that:
- Describes the high-risk construction work (HRCW) to be carried out
- Identifies hazards arising from the work
- Describes control measures to be implemented
- Explains how control measures will be implemented, monitored, and reviewed

> [!important] Legal Requirement
> High-risk construction work must not commence until a SWMS has been prepared and communicated to workers.

## When is SWMS Required?

SWMS mandatory for **high-risk construction work** (WHS Reg 291):

- Work with risk of fall >2m
- Work on telecommunications towers  
- Work near energized electrical installations (>440V or underground cables)
- Work in/near confined spaces
- Demolition work
- Work involving disturbance of asbestos
- Work on/near pressurized gas distribution mains
- Diving work
- Work in/near water or liquid (drowning risk)
- Work in shafts/tunnels
- Use of explosives
- Work on roads requiring traffic management
- Tilt-up and precast concrete erection

## Who Prepares SWMS?

**PCBU carrying out HRCW** must prepare SW MS.

**Typically:**
- Contractor performing the work
- May be prepared by competent person (supervisor, safety advisor)
- Must involve consultation with workers who will do the work

> [!tip] Worker Input Essential
> Workers doing the job have best knowledge of practical hazards and effective controls. Their input makes SWMS more effective.

## SWMS Requirements

### Must Include (WHS Reg 298):

**1. Description of HRCW:**
- What work will be done
- Where and when
- Equipment/materials to be used

**2. Hazards:**
- Identify all reasonably foreseeable hazards
- Include both obvious and less obvious risks

**3. Risk Assessment:**
- Likelihood and severity of harm
- Existing controls considered

**4. Control Measures:**
- Follow [[Step-3-Control-Risks|hierarchy of control]]
- Specific controls for each identified hazard
- Who is responsible for implementing

**5. Implementation:**
- How controls will be put in place
- When they will be implemented
- Who will ensure compliance

**6. Monitoring and Review:**
- How effectiveness will be monitored
- When and how SWMS will be reviewed

### Additional Good Practice:

- Emergency procedures
- PPE requirements
- Competency/licensing requirements
- Permits required
- Inspection/testing requirements
- Reference to relevant codes of practice

## Preparing a SWMS

### Step 1: Break Work into Steps

Divide work into logical sequence of steps.

**Example - Excavation for Footings:**
1. Locate underground services
2. Mark out excavation area
3. Remove topsoil and stockpile
4. Excavate to required depth
5. Shore/batter walls if required
6. Inspect excavation
7. Place footings
8. Backfill

### Step 2: Identify Hazards for Each Step

For each work step, identify hazards.

**Example - Step 3: Excavate to required depth:**
- Striking underground services (gas, electricity, water)
- Collapse of excavation walls
- Workers falling into excavation
- Mobile plant (excavator) striking workers
- Noise from equipment

### Step 3: Assess Risks

Consider likelihood and severity.

**Example - Striking underground gas main:**
- Severity: Death (explosion/fire)
- Likelihood: Possible (if services not located)
- Risk Level: Extreme

### Step 4: Determine Controls

Apply hierarchy of control.

**Example - Striking underground services:**
- **Elimination**: Not practicable (excavation required)
- **Engineering**: Locate services (Dial Before You Dig), hand dig within 500mm
- **Administrative**: Trained excavator operator, exclusion zone, supervision
- **PPE**: Hi-vis clothing, hard hat, safety boots

### Step 5: Document in SWMS

Use clear, simple language. Include diagrams if helpful.

**Format:**
| Work Step | Hazards | Risk Level | Controls | Person Responsible |
|-----------|---------|------------|----------|-------------------|
| Excavate to depth | Underground services | Extreme | 1. Services located (DBYD)<br>2. Hand dig within 500mm<br>3. Trained operator<br>4. Exclusion zone | Site Supervisor |

## Implementing SWMS

### Before Work Starts:

**1. Review SWMS with Workers:**
- Toolbox talk to go through SWMS
- Explain hazards and controls
- Answer questions
- Get worker input (may identify additional hazards/better controls)
- Workers sign to confirm understanding

**2. Ensure Controls in Place:**
- Equipment available
- Materials delivered
- Permits obtained
- Workers trained/licensed

**3. Make SWMS Accessible:**
- Copy at workplace
- Available to all workers
- Available to WHS inspectors

### During Work:

**1. Follow SWMS:**
- Workers must follow documented controls
- Supervisors monitor compliance

**2. Monitor Effectiveness:**
- Are controls working as intended?
- Any issues or near-misses?

**3. Review if Circumstances Change:**
- New hazards identified
- Controls not effective
- Work method changes
- Incident occurs

## Reviewing and Revising SWMS

**Must Review:**
- Before work commences (each time SWMS used)
- If control measures change
- If new hazards identified
- After incident or near-miss
- At request of health and safety representative

**Process:**
- Consult with workers
- Identify what needs changing
- Update SWMS
- Communicate changes to all affected workers

> [!warning] Don't Set and Forget
> SWMS is living document. Review regularly and whenever circumstances change.

## SWMS on Construction Projects

**Principal Contractor Must:**
- Collect SWMS from all contractors doing HRCW
- Review SWMS for adequacy
- Ensure no conflict between different contractors' SWMS
- Ensure SWMS implemented
- Keep copies readily accessible

**Contractors Must:**
- Provide SWMS to principal contractor
- Not commence HRCW until SWMS prepared
- Implement SWMS
- Review if circumstances change

## Record Keeping

**Must Keep:**
- Copy of SWMS for duration of work
- Records of worker consultation/sign-offs
- **Retain for 2 years** after work completed

**Regulator Access:**
- WHS inspectors may request SWMS
- Must be able to produce on request

## Practical Examples

### Example 1: Installing Roof Trusses (Fall Risk >2m)

**HRCW:** Work at heights with fall risk >2m

**Work Steps:**
1. Deliver trusses to site
2. Crane lift trusses to roof
3. Position and brace first truss
4. Install remaining trusses
5. Install permanent bracing

**Key Hazards:**
- Falls from roof edges (5m fall)
- Trusses becoming unstable before bracing
- Workers struck by crane/load
- Load falling from crane

**Controls:**
- Edge protection installed before work starts
- Workers wear harnesses (backup to edge protection)
- Exclusion zone under crane operations
- Trusses temporarily braced immediately after placement
- Dogger directs crane, clear communication
- Weather restrictions (no work in high wind/rain)

### Example 2: Excavation Near Underground Services

**HRCW:** Excavation >1.5m deep near underground services

**Work Steps:**
1. Service location
2. Mark services on ground
3. Hand dig trial holes to expose services
4. Excavate with machine (stay >500mm from services)
5. Support/protect exposed services

**Key Hazards:**
- Striking gas/electrical/water services
- Excavation collapse
- Falls into excavation

**Controls:**
- Dial Before You Dig (plans obtained)
- Cable locator used to confirm position
- Hand dig within 500mm of located services
- Trained excavator operator
- Exclusion zone around excavation
- Edge protection/barriers
- Walls battered or shored if required

## Common Mistakes to Avoid

**❌ Generic SWMS:**
Using template without tailoring to specific site and work

**✓ Site-Specific:**
Customize for actual conditions, equipment, workers

**❌ Too Vague:**
"Use appropriate PPE" - what PPE specifically?

**✓ Specific:**
"Wear P2 respirator (fit-tested), safety glasses, gloves"

**❌ No Worker Input:**
Office-prepared without consulting workers

**✓ Collaborative:**
Involve workers in preparation and review

**❌ File and Forget:**
Prepared to comply, never referenced again

**✓ Active Document:**
Reviewed at toolbox talks, updated as needed, actually used
