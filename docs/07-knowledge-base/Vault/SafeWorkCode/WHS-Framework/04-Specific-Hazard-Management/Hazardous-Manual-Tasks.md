# Hazardous Manual Tasks

## What are Hazardous Manual Tasks?

Hazardous manual tasks are tasks that require a person to lift, lower, push, pull, carry or otherwise move, hold or restrain any person, animal or thing that involves risk of musculoskeletal disorder (MSD).

**Common Construction Examples:**
- Lifting and carrying materials (bags of cement, timber, bricks)
- Placing and tying reinforcement steel (rebar)
- Laying pavers or blocks
- Operating jackhammers or compactors (vibration)
- Repetitive nail gunning or screwing
- Prolonged awkward postures (overhead work, confined spaces)

## What are Musculoskeletal Disorders?

MSDs are injuries or disorders of muscles, tendons, ligaments, joints, nerves, blood vessels or related soft tissues.

**Common MSDs in Construction:**
- Back injuries (strains, disc problems)
- Shoulder injuries (rotator cuff, bursitis)
- Neck pain
- Knee problems
- Hand/wrist injuries (carpal tunnel syndrome, tendonitis)

> [!warning] Long-Term Impact
> MSDs develop over time through repeated exposure. Early symptoms (discomfort, aching) indicate risk and need addressing.

## Risk Factors for MSDs

### Characteristics of Hazardous Manual Tasks

**1. Repetitive or Sustained Force**
- Lifting heavy loads repeatedly
- Sustained gripping or pinching
- Repetitive movements (hammering, cutting)

**2. High or Sudden Force**
- Lifting very heavy items
- Jerking or snatching loads
- Catching falling objects
- Impact forces (jackhammer vibration)

**3. Repetitive Movement**
- Performing same movement repeatedly
- Example: Repetitive bricklaying, screw driving, grinding

**4. Sustained or Awkward Postures**
- Bending forward (tying steel, placing pavers)
- Reaching overhead (ceiling work)
- Kneeling or squatting (tiling, waterproofing)
- Twisting (turning with load)
- Working in confined spaces

**5. Exposure to Vibration**
- Hand-arm vibration (grinders, drills, breakers)
- Whole-body vibration (operating heavy plant)

## Who Has Duties?

### PCBUs

Must:
- Identify hazardous manual tasks
- Assess MSD risks
- Eliminate or minimize risks
- Consult with workers
- Provide information and training
- Review controls

### Designers, Manufacturers, Suppliers

Must:
- Design to eliminate/minimize manual handling
- Consider weight, size, shape of products
- Provide handling information

## Risk Management Process

### 1. Identify Hazardous Manual Tasks

**Methods:**
- Observe work activities
- Talk to workers (discomfort surveys)
- Review injury/incident reports
- Check design/planning documents

**Construction-Specific Indicators:**
- Materials supplied in heavy units (cement bags, pavers)
- Repetitive tasks (bricklaying, fixing)
- Confined or restricted work areas
- Overhead or below-knee work required

### 2. Assess Risks

**When to Assess:**
- When hazardous task identified
- Before introducing new tasks, equipment, layouts
- After MSD injuries reported
- When workers report discomfort

**What to Consider:**
- **Loads**: Weight, size, shape, stability
- **Actions**: Postures, movements, duration, frequency
- **Workspace**: Layout, heights, access, lighting
- **Environment**: Surfaces, weather, space constraints
- **Worker**: Training, experience, fatigue

### 3. Control Risks: Hierarchy of Control

**Level 1: Elimination**

- Eliminate need for manual task entirely
- Example: Pre-mixed concrete delivery eliminates mixing bags on-site

**Level 2: Substitution/Engineering**

**Mechanical Aids:**
- Forklifts, cranes, hoists for lifting
- Trolleys, wheelbarrows for transporting
- Conveyors for moving materials
- Elevated work platforms instead of ladders

**Example:** Use telehandler to lift pallet of bricks to upper level instead of manual carrying.

**Redesign Task:**
- Reduce weight/size of loads (smaller cement bags, lighter blocks)
- Improve layout (materials closer to work area)
- Adjust work heights (raise/lower to reduce bending)
- Provide better access (platforms, pathways)

**Example:** Store formwork materials at waist height on racks instead of on ground.

**Use Tools and Equipment:**
- Mechanical lifting devices
- Slide sheets or rollers
- Adjustable height benches
- Power tools to reduce force

**Level 3: Administrative Controls**

- Job rotation to vary tasks and postures
- Task pacing (rest breaks, varied work)
- Team lifting for heavy/awkward loads
- Training in safe lifting techniques

> [!tip] Team Lifting
> For loads >20kg or awkward shapes, use two or more workers. Coordinate lift with clear signals.

**Level 3: PPE**

PPE does not control manual handling risks. Focus on higher-level controls.

(Note: Supportive devices like back belts are not effective and not recommended)

### 4. Review Controls

Review when:
- Control measures not effective
- MSDs or discomfort reported
- Work processes change
- New equipment or layout

## Practical Construction Examples

### Example 1: Laying Concrete Blocks

**Hazard:**
- Blocks weigh 15-20kg each
- Repetitive lifting from ground level
- Bending and twisting
- Several hundred blocks per day

**Controls:**

**Engineering:**
- Deliver blocks on pallets with forklift
- Position pallet close to work area (reduce carrying distance)
- Elevate pallet on trestles to waist height (eliminate bending)
- Provide adjustable scaffold for working at height

**Administrative:**
- Job rotation (alternate between laying and other tasks)
- Two workers team-laying for speed and reduced individual load
- Adequate breaks

**Result:** Significantly reduced bending and twisting, load easier to grasp from waist height.

### Example 2: Tying Reinforcement Steel

**Hazard:**
- Sustained bending and squatting
- Repetitive twisting motion (thousands per day)
- Awkward hand positions

**Controls:**

**Engineering:**
- Use clip-on bar ties instead of manual wire tying (faster, less repetitive)
- Battery-powered rebar tying gun (eliminates manual twisting)
- Work platforms to raise worker position where practicable

**Administrative:**
- Job rotation to reduce daily exposure
- Training in neutral postures

**Result:** Manual twisting eliminated, reduced bending time.

### Example 3: Moving Plasterboard Sheets

**Hazard:**
- Sheets 2.4m x 1.2m, weight 20-30kg
- Awkward to handle (large, unwieldy)
- Carrying required (often up stairs/ladders)

**Controls:**

**Engineering:**
- **Panel hoist/lifter** to move and position sheets
- Storage racks at appropriate height
- Material hoist to upper floors (eliminate manual carrying up stairs)

**Work Organization:**
- Deliver materials as close to installation point as possible
- Two-person team for manual handling when hoist unavailable

**Result:** Eliminates most manual carrying, significantly reduces awkward postures.

## Special Considerations

### Working Overhead

**Risks:**
- Shoulder and neck strain
- Arm fatigue
- Difficulty controlling loads above head

**Controls:**
- Elevate work platform to bring work to chest/waist height
- Use mechanical aids (ceiling panel lifters)
- Limit duration of overhead work
- Provide armrests or supports

### Working at Ground Level

**Risks:**
- Prolonged bending, kneeling, squatting
- Back and knee strain

**Controls:**
- Raise work height (platforms, adjustable benches)
- Knee pads for kneeling tasks
- Kneeling stools or creepers
- Vary postures regularly

### Confined Spaces

**Risks:**
- Restricted postures
- Difficulty using mechanical aids
- Limited access for materials

**Controls:**
- Pre-assemble components outside confined space where possible
- Use smaller, lighter materials
- Provide adequate access for material delivery
- Limit time in confined space

## Information and Training

Workers should be trained in:
- Recognizing hazardous manual tasks and MSD risks
- How to use mechanical aids and equipment
- Safe work practices for unavoidable manual tasks
- Importance of reporting discomfort early
- Warm-up and stretching (supplement to controls, not substitute)
