# Work Environment and Facilities

## PCBU Duties for Work Environment

PCBUs must ensure the work environment does not pose risks to health and safety, including providing:

- Adequate facilities (toilets, drinking water, eating areas)
- Safe access and egress
- Adequate lighting, ventilation, temperature
- Suitable work surfaces and seating
- Protection from weather

Must provide:
- Separate facilities for men and women (or unisex single cubicles)
- Toilet paper, hand washing facilities
- Adequate lighting and ventilation
- Privacy (lockable doors)
- Located within reasonable distance (typically <200m)

**Portable Toilets:**

- Adequate number for workforce
- Hand washing facilities or hand sanitizer

### Washing Facilities

Required when:
- Work involves substances that could contaminate skin
- Work is physically demanding causing perspiration
- For personal hygiene after using toilet

- Towels or hand dryers

## Drinking Water

**Requirements:**
- Adequate supply of **cool, clean drinking water**

- Cups/drinking vessels (unless bubbler)
- Protected from contamination

**Construction Sites:**
- Drinking water stations or coolers
- More frequent access in hot weather
- Ice or refrigeration in summer

> [!warning] Hot Weather
> Dehydration causes heat stress. Ensure ample drinking water and encourage regular drinks, especially in hot conditions.

## Eating Facilities

**Requirements:**
- Designated area for eating meals
- Protected from workplace contaminants
- Seating
- Protection from weather
- Tables or flat surfaces

**Construction Sites:**
- Lunch shed or demountable building
- Benches with shelter
- Away from dust, chemicals, noise
- Hand washing before eating

## Temperature and Ventilation

### Working in Heat

**Risks:**
- Heat stress, heat stroke (potentially fatal)
- Dehydration, fatigue
- Reduced concentration (increased accident risk)

**Controls:**
- Shade structures, rest areas
- Drinking water readily available
- Modify work schedule (work during cooler hours)
- Frequent rest breaks
- Allow acclimatization for new workers
- Monitor workers for heat stress symptoms

**Heat Stress Symptoms:**
- Excessive sweating or stopped sweating
- Dizziness, nausea, headache
- Rapid pulse, confusion
- Loss of consciousness

**Emergency Response:**
Move to cool area, remove excess clothing, cool with water, seek medical help.

### Working in Cold

**Risks:**
- Hypothermia, frostbite
- Reduced dexterity (accident risk)
- Slips on ice

**Controls:**
- Warm break areas
- Hot drinks available
- Allow frequent warm-up breaks
- Appropriate clothing (layered, waterproof)

### Ventilation

**Natural Ventilation:**
- Outdoor work generally adequate
- Open doors/windows in enclosed areas

**Mechanical Ventilation:**
Required when:
- Natural ventilation insufficient
- Contaminants generated (dust, fumes, vapors)
- Confined spaces

**See:** [[Hazardous-Chemicals-Overview|Hazardous Chemicals]] for ventilation requirements.

## Lighting

**Requirements:**
- Adequate lighting for safe work performance
- Avoid glare and shadows
- Emergency lighting for evacuation

**Construction Sites:**
- Natural lighting where possible
- Task lighting for detailed work
- Temporary site lighting for evening/enclosed work
- Portable lights for confined spaces

## Access and Egress

### Safe Access

Workers must have safe means to:
- Enter and leave the workplace
- Move around the workplace
- Access their work positions

**Construction Sites:**
- Clear pathways (min 600mm wide)
- Free from obstacles and trip hazards
- Signposted where needed
- Separated from vehicle routes
- Stairs, ramps, or ladders to different levels

### Stairs and Ramps

**Stairs:**
- Firm, level treads
- Adequate width (min 600mm)
- Handrails both sides for flights >1m rise
- Non-slip surface
- Adequate lighting

**Ramps:**
- Maximum gradient 1:8 (steeper requires steps)
- Non-slip surface
- Edge protection if fall risk
- Handrails for steep ramps

### Ladders

**When Permitted:**
- Short-duration work
- Low-risk work
- Where other access not practicable

**Requirements:**
- Industrial-rated ladder (not domestic)
- Inspected before use
- Secured (tied off or footed)
- Correct angle (1:4 ratio)
- 3-point contact maintained
- Extend 1m above landing platform

**See:** [[Managing-Risk-of-Falls|Falls from Heights]] for detailed ladder guidance.

## Housekeeping

**Good housekeeping prevents:**
- Slips, trips, and falls
- Fire risks
- Pest infestation
- Exposure to contaminants

**Practices:**
- Clear walkways and work areas daily
- Remove waste regularly
- Store materials in designated areas
- Clean up spills immediately
- Organize tools and equipment

**Construction Sites:**
- Dedicated waste bins (general, recyclable, hazardous)
- Regular site cleanup schedule
- "Clean as you go" culture

## First Aid

**Requirements:**
- First aid kits readily accessible
- Contents appropriate for work hazards
- Trained first aiders

**Construction Sites (typical):**
- 1 first aider per 25 workers (high-risk work)
- Multiple kits at large/dispersed sites
- Vehicle-mounted kits for mobile crews
- Emergency eyewash where chemicals used

**See:** [[First-Aid|First Aid Requirements]] for detailed guidance.

## Seating and Work Surfaces

**Where work can be done seated:**
Must provide:
- Suitable seating (adjustable where practicable)
- Adequate workspace
- Work at appropriate height

**Construction Context:**
While much construction work requires standing/moving, provide seating for:
- Break areas
- Site offices
- Guard duties/monitoring positions
- Where work allows (surveys, inspections)

## Remote and Isolated Work

**Additional Considerations:**
- Communication systems (phone, radio, satellite)
- Check-in procedures
- Emergency response procedures
- First aid provisions
- Access to facilities (may require portable toilets, water)
