# Managing Risks of Respirable Crystalline Silica

## What is Respirable Crystalline Silica?

Respirable crystalline silica (RCS) is fine dust containing silica particles small enough to be inhaled deep into the lungs. Silica is a natural component of many materials including:

- Sand, soil, granite, sandstone
- Concrete, mortar, brick, tiles
- **Engineered stone** (artificial stone benchtops, up to 95% silica)

When these materials are cut, ground, drilled, crushed, or demolished, silica dust is generated.

> [!warning] Serious Health Hazard
> Breathing silica dust causes **silicosis** (incurable lung disease), lung cancer, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), and kidney disease.

## High-Risk Construction Activities

**Dry cutting/grinding/drilling:**
- Concrete, masonry, brick, tiles
- Engineered stone (kitchen benchtops, bathroom vanities)
- Natural stone, sandstone
- Asphalt, roadways

**Abrasive blasting:**
- Using sand or silica-containing abrasives

**Demolition:**
- Concrete structures
- Brick and masonry buildings

**Tunneling and excavation:**
- Rock containing silica

## Exposure Standard

**WHS Regulation 50:**
- **0.05 mg/m³** (8-hour time-weighted average)

This is a very small amount—effective dust control essential.

## Who Has Duties?

### PCBUs

Must:
- Identify if silica dust generated
- Assess risks of exposure
- Implement dust control measures following hierarchy of control
- Conduct air monitoring
- Provide health monitoring
- Provide information and training
- Keep exposure records

### Designers, Manufacturers, Suppliers

Must:
- Design plant/processes to minimize silica dust
- Provide information on silica content
- Include dust control features in equipment

## Risk Management Process

### 1. Identify Hazards

**Check if materials contain silica:**
- Concrete, brick, stone, tiles (assume contain silica)
- Engineered stone (very high silica content)
- Safety Data Sheets for manufactured products
- Natural stone and rock

**Identify dust-generating activities:**
- Cutting, grinding, drilling, sanding
- Demolition, breaking, crushing
- Dry sweeping of silica-containing dust

### 2. Assess Risks

**Consider:**
- Silica content of material (engineered stone = extreme risk)
- Type of activity (dry cutting worse than wet)
- Duration and frequency of exposure
- Enclosed vs. open-air work
- Number of workers exposed

**Risk Indicators:**
- Visible dust clouds
- Dust settling on surfaces
- Workers coughing or irritated

### 3. Control Risks: Hierarchy of Control

**Level 1: Elimination**

- Order pre-cut materials (no on-site cutting required)
- Use alternative materials (lower silica content)
- Design out need for cutting/modification

**Example:** Pre-fabricated concrete panels eliminate on-site cutting.

**Level 2: Substitution**

- Substitute lower-silica alternatives where possible
- Use non-silica abrasives for blasting

**Example:** For certain applications, use low-silica aggregate concrete.

**Level 2: Engineering Controls (CRITICAL)**

Engineering controls are the primary defense against silica dust:

**On-Tool Water Suppression:**
- Continuously supplies water to cutting/grinding point
- Binds dust before it becomes airborne
- Mandatory for most silica work

**On-Tool Dust Extraction:**
- Captures dust at source via vacuum system
- HEPA-filtered vacuum (H or M-class)
- Effective for drilling and some grinding

**Combined Water + Extraction:**
- Most effective control
- Example: Wet-cutting saw with vacuum shroud

**Ventilation:**
- Local exhaust ventilation for enclosed work
- Natural ventilation for outdoor work (still requires other controls)

**Isolation:**
- Separate cutting area from other workers
- Exclusion zones during high-dust activities
- Enclose dust-generating processes

**Level 3: Administrative Controls**

- Limit time workers exposed to dust
- Rotate workers to reduce individual exposure
- Safe work procedures and [[SWMS|Safe Work Method Statements]]
- Regular housekeeping (wet methods or HEPA vacuum only—never dry sweep)
- Training on silica risks and controls

**Level 3: Personal Protective Equipment**

> [!warning] PPE is Last Line of Defense
> Never rely on PPE alone. Engineering controls must be primary.

**Respiratory Protection:**
- **P2 or P3 respirators** (disposable or reusable)
- Must be fit-tested to individual worker
- Quantitative fit testing required
- Replace when breathing resistance increases

**For high-risk work (e.g., engineered stone):**
- Powered air-purifying respirators (PAPR)
- Supplied-air respirators

**Other PPE:**
- Safety glasses/goggles
- Hearing protection (tools generate noise)
- Work clothing (changed regularly, not taken home)

### 4. Maintain and Review

- Inspect and maintain water suppression systems daily
- Test dust extraction equipment regularly
- Replace vacuum filters as needed
- Check respirators before each use
- Conduct air monitoring
- Review controls after incidents

## Engineered Stone—Specific Requirements

**Extremely High Risk:**
Engineered stone contains up to 95% silica. Special controls required.

**Mandatory Controls:**
- **On-tool water suppression** for all cutting, grinding, drilling
- **On-tool dust extraction** where water alone insufficient
- **Respiratory protection** (P2/P3 minimum, PAPR recommended)
- **Health monitoring** for all workers
- **Silica Dust Control Plan**

**Prohibited Practices:**
- Dry cutting (without water suppression)
- Using compressed air for cleaning
- Dry sweeping

## Air Monitoring

**When Required:**
- Uncertain if exposure exceeds standard
- To verify control effectiveness
- After changing work methods or controls
- Regularly for high-risk work (engineered stone)

**Who Conducts Monitoring:**
- Competent person (occupational hygienist)
- Personal air samplers worn by workers
- Samples analyzed by NATA-accredited laboratory

**Results:**
- If exposure exceeds 0.05 mg/m³, immediate action required
- Improve controls, re-monitor to confirm effectiveness
- Keep records for 30 years

## Health Monitoring

### When Required (WHS Reg 56)

Health monitoring mandatory if worker:
- Carries out ongoing work with silica materials, AND
- Uses powered tools or equipment, OR
- Is at risk of exposure exceeding 0.05 mg/m³

**This includes:**
- All workers cutting, grinding engineered stone
- Workers regularly cutting/grinding concrete, brick, stone
- Abrasive blasters using silica abrasives

### What Health Monitoring Involves

- Medical history and examination
- Respiratory function tests (spirometry)
- Chest X-ray or CT scan (baseline and periodic)
- Conducted by qualified medical practitioner
- Records kept for 30 years

**Worker Rights:**
- Access to own health records
- Confidential medical information
- No cost to worker

See [[Health-Monitoring-Overview|Health Monitoring]] for details.

## Silica Dust Control Plan

For ongoing silica work, prepare written plan including:
- Tasks that generate silica dust
- Risk assessment results
- Control measures for each task
- Air monitoring schedule
- Health monitoring requirements
- Training requirements
- Review schedule

## Practical Construction Example

**Scenario:** Cutting concrete slabs for plumbing penetrations

### Hazard Identification
- Concrete contains crystalline silica
- Dry cutting generates respirable dust
- Multiple cuts required daily
- Workers exposed throughout project

### Risk Assessment
- High risk: Regular exposure, high dust generation
- Multiple workers involved

### Controls Implemented

**Engineering:**
- **Wet-cutting saw** with continuous water supply
- **On-tool extraction** for handheld grinder (backup)
- Work outdoors where possible (ventilation)
- Exclusion zone 3 meters around cutting

**Administrative:**
- SWMS prepared for silica work
- Trained operators only
- Wet methods for cleanup (no dry sweeping)
- Work clothing changed daily

**PPE:**
- **P2 respirators** (fit-tested to each worker)
- Safety glasses
- Hearing protection
- Gloves

**Monitoring:**
- Air monitoring conducted (initial and periodic)
- Results below 0.05 mg/m³ (controls effective)
- Health monitoring arranged for all exposed workers

### Review
- Daily check: Water system functioning
- Weekly: Inspect equipment, confirm procedures followed
- After project: Review effectiveness, update controls for next project

## Clearance and Cleanup

**After Silica Dust Work:**

**Never:**
- Dry sweep or use compressed air
- Allow dust to accumulate
- Use standard shop vacuums (spread dust)

**Always:**
- Wet wipe surfaces
- Use HEPA-filtered vacuum (H or M-class)
- Dispose of waste properly (sealed bags)
- Clean work clothing (commercial laundry, not home)

## Information and Training
