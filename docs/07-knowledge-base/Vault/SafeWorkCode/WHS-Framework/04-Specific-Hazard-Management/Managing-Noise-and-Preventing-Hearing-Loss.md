# Managing Noise and Preventing Hearing Loss

## Noise as a Hazard

Excessive noise exposure causes permanent, irreversible hearing loss. Construction work involves many noise-producing activities making hearing protection essential.

**Common Construction Noise Sources:**
- Power tools (grinders, saws, nail guns, jackhammers)
- Heavy plant and equipment (excavators, loaders, compactors)
- Concrete cutting and drilling
- Impact tools (jackhammers, post drivers)
- Generators and compressors

> [!warning] Permanent Damage
> Noise-induced hearing loss is permanent and cannot be reversed. Prevention is the only solution.

## Exposure Standards

**WHS Regulation 56:**
- **LAeq,8h = 85 dB(A)** (8-hour time-weighted average)
- **LC,peak = 140 dB(C)** (peak noise level)

**What this means:**
- Average noise over 8 hours must not exceed 85 dB(A)
- Instantaneous peak noise must not exceed 140 dB(C)

**Indicative Noise Levels:**
- Normal conversation: 60 dB(A)
- Busy traffic: 80 dB(A)
- Lawn mower: 90 dB(A)
- Chainsaw: 110 dB(A)
- Jackhammer: 120 dB(A)

> [!tip] Conversation Test
> If you need to raise your voice to talk to someone 1 meter away, noise levels are likely approaching or exceeding 85 dB(A).

## Who Has Duties?

### PCBUs

Must:
- Identify noise hazards
- Assess risks of hearing damage
- Eliminate or minimize noise exposure
- Ensure exposure below standards
- Provide hearing protectors if engineering controls insufficient
- Provide information and training
- Conduct audiometric testing where required

### Designers, Manufacturers, Suppliers

Must:
- Design plant to minimize noise generation
- Provide noise emission data
- Include noise control features in equipment

## Risk Management Process

### 1. Identify Hazards

**Indicators of Noise Hazard:**
- Need to shout to be heard 1 meter away
- Ringing ears or muffled hearing after work
- Complaints from workers about noise
- Noise complaints from neighbors/public

**Review:**
- Manufacturer specifications for equipment (noise ratings)
- Previous noise assessments
- Incident reports

### 2. Assess Risks

**When Noise Assessment Required:**
- Uncertain if exposure exceeds standards
- To verify control effectiveness
- After changes to work processes or equipment

**Who Conducts Assessment:**
- Competent person (occupational hygienist, acoustician)
- Uses calibrated sound level meters
- Personal noise dosimeters for individual exposure

### 3. Control Risks: Hierarchy of Control

**Level 1: Elimination**

- Modify process to not require noisy equipment
- Example: Use mechanical fixing instead of impact tools where possible

**Level 2: Substitution**

- Replace with quieter equipment or methods
- Example: Electric tools instead of pneumatic tools
- Example: Hydraulic splitters instead of jackhammers

**Level 2: Isolation**

- Separate workers from noise source
- Relocate noisy equipment away from workers
- Establish noise exclusion zones
- Remote operation of noisy plant

**Level 2: Engineering Controls**

**Noise Reduction at Source:**
- Install mufflers on exhaust systems
- Use damping materials on vibrating surfaces
- Maintain equipment (worn parts increase noise)
- Enclose noisy equipment in acoustic barriers

**Example:** Fit compressor with acoustic enclosure and muffled exhaust.

**Barriers and Screens:**
- Acoustic barriers between noise source and workers
- Sound-absorbing materials in enclosed spaces

**Maintenance:**
- Regular maintenance reduces noise (worn bearings, loose parts)
- Replace damaged mufflers and acoustic seals

**Level 3: Administrative Controls**

- Limit time workers exposed to high noise
- Job rotation to reduce individual exposure
- Restrict access to high-noise areas
- Schedule noisy work when fewer workers present

**Level 3: Personal Protective Equipment**

> [!important] Last Resort
> Hearing protection is least effective control. Use only after higher controls implemented.

**Types of Hearing Protection:**

**Earplugs:**
- Foam, pre-molded, or custom-fitted
- Inserted into ear canal
- Typical reduction: 20-30 dB

**Earmuffs:**
- Cushioned cups over ears
- Typical reduction: 20-35 dB
- More visible (easier to check compliance)

**Selection:**
- Must provide sufficient attenuation to reduce noise below 85 dB(A)
- Consider comfort (workers more likely to wear)
- Hygiene (clean, replace when worn)

**Limitations:**
- Only effective when worn correctly and consistently
- Gaps or poor fit reduce effectiveness dramatically
- Workers may remove during breaks but still in noisy area

### 4. Maintain and Review

- Inspect and maintain noise control equipment
- Monitor noise levels after changes
- Check hearing protector condition
- Review after workers report hearing issues
- Conduct audiometric testing

## Audiometric Testing

**When Required (WHS Reg 58):**
If worker exposed to noise exceeding standards and at risk of hearing loss.

**What it Involves:**
- Baseline hearing test (before exposure)
- Periodic re-testing (annually for high-risk, every 2 years otherwise)
- Conducted by qualified person (audiologist, audiometrist)
- Identifies early signs of hearing loss

**Benefits:**
- Detects hearing loss early
- Allows intervention before significant damage
- Confirms control measures working

**Worker Rights:**
- Access to test results
- Confidential health information
- No cost to worker

## Practical Construction Example

**Scenario:** Concrete cutting for service trenches

### Hazard Identification
- Petrol-powered concrete saw generates 110 dB(A)
- Workers cutting for several hours per day
- Other workers in vicinity

### Risk Assessment
- High risk: Exposure well above 85 dB(A)
- Operator and nearby workers affected

### Controls Implemented

**Engineering:**
- **Selected electric saw** (quieter than petrol, 95 dB(A))
- Acoustic barrier erected around cutting area
- Work during day (fewer workers on site)

**Isolation:**
- Exclusion zone 5 meters from saw
- Only operator and one offsider in zone
- Signage indicating high-noise area

**Administrative:**
- Limit continuous cutting to 1-hour blocks
- Job rotation among qualified operators
- Advance notice to other trades (relocate if possible)

**PPE:**
- **Class 5 earmuffs** for operator (30 dB reduction)
- **Earplugs** for offsider (25 dB reduction)
- Hearing protection mandatory in exclusion zone

### Monitoring
- Noise assessment confirmed exposure <85 dB(A) with controls
- Audiometric testing arranged for regular operators

## Other Noise Effects

### Tinnitus
Ringing, buzzing, or whistling in ears. May be temporary or permanent.

### Communication and Safety

High noise:
- Impairs communication
- Prevents hearing warning signals
- Masks approaching vehicles/equipment
- Increases accident risk

**Controls:**
- Visual warning signals in high-noise areas
- Hand signals for communication
- Flashing lights on mobile plant

### Stress and Fatigue

Prolonged noise exposure causes:
- Increased stress levels
- Mental fatigue
- Reduced concentration
- Lower productivity

## Information and Training

Workers must be informed about:
- Risks of noise exposure and hearing loss
- Noise levels in their work areas
- How to use and maintain hearing protection
- How to identify when noise controls not working
- Audiometric testing requirements
- Reporting hearing changes
