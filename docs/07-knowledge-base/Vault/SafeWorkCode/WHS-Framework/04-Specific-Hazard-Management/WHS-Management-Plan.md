## What is a WHS Management Plan?

A WHS Management Plan is a document that describes how WHS will be managed for a **construction project** (≥$250,000).

**Purpose:**
- Coordinate WHS across entire project
- Ensure all contractors aware of site-specific hazards
- Establish consistent WHS practices
- Facilitate consultation and cooperation

## When Required

**Mandatory for:** Construction projects with total cost ≥ $250,000

**Prepared by:** Principal contractor

## Principal Contractor Duties

**Principal contractor must:**
- Prepare WHS Management Plan before work starts
- Ensure plan implemented
- Review and revise as needed
- Make plan available to all workers and visitors
- Consult workers when preparing/revising plan

Description of arrangements for ensuring health and safety, including:

**Site Management Structure:**
- Who is responsible for WHS (principal contractor, supervisors)
- How responsibilities communicated

**Risk Management:**
- How hazards will be identified
- How risks will be assessed and controlled
- SWMS management (collection, review, implementation)

**Specific Hazard Management:**

- Refer to site-specific controls

### 2. Consultation, Cooperation, Coordination

**How the principal contractor will:**
- Consult with workers (methods, frequency)
- Facilitate cooperation between contractors

### 3. Site-Specific Induction

**Induction program covering:**
- Site layout, emergency exits
- Site-specific hazards
- Location of facilities
- Emergency procedures
- Key personnel
- Site rules (PPE, permits, etc.)

**Records:**
- How induction attendance recorded
- Who conducts inductions

### 4. Incident and Emergency Management

**Incidents:**
- Reporting procedures
- Investigation process
- Corrective action implementation
- Notification to regulator (notifiable incidents)

**Emergencies:**
- Emergency procedures (evacuation, medical, fire)
- Emergency contact numbers
- Location of emergency equipment
- Assembly points

### 5. Monitoring and Review

**How WHS performance will be monitored:**
- Site inspections (frequency, who conducts)
- SWMS compliance checks
- Incident trend analysis
- Worker feedback mechanisms

**When plan will be reviewed:**
- Regularly (e.g., monthly)
- After significant incidents
- When work scope changes
- At worker or HSR request

## Preparing a WHS Management Plan

### Step 1: Gather Information

**About the Project:**
- Scope of work
- Duration and program
- Number of contractors and workers
- Site location and constraints

**Existing Information:**
- Previous WHS plans (similar projects)
- Designer's safety reports
- Asbestos registers
- Service location plans
- Site-specific hazards

### Step 2: Consult

**Consult with:**
- Workers (through HSRs or directly)
- Contractors and subcontractors
- Client/building owner
- Designers

**Topics:**
- Hazards and risks
- Control measures
- Emergency procedures
- Site rules and arrangements

### Step 3: Document

Write plan covering all required elements (see above).

**Keep it:**
- Clear and concise
- Specific to the project (not generic)
- Practical and usable
- Cross-referenced to SWMS and procedures

### Step 4: Implement

**Communicate plan to:**
- All workers (during induction)
- All contractors
- Visitors to site

**Ensure:**
- Plan readily accessible (site office, displayed)
- Everyone knows their responsibilities
- Arrangements described in plan actually happen

### Step 5: Monitor and Review

**Regular review:**
- Is plan being followed?
- Are arrangements effective?
- Any changes needed?

**Revise when:**
- Work scope changes
- New hazards identified
- Incidents indicate gaps
- Workers or HSRs request

## Relationship with SWMS

**WHS Management Plan:**
- Covers entire project
- High-level coordination
- Prepared by principal contractor

**SWMS:**
- Covers specific high-risk construction work
- Detailed task-level controls
- Prepared by contractor doing the work

**Integration:**
- Principal contractor collects all SWMS
- Reviews for adequacy and conflicts
- SWMS must align with WHS Management Plan

## Practical Example

**Project:** Multi-storey apartment building construction
- Total cost: $12 million
- Duration: 18 months
- Peak workforce: 80 workers
- 15+ subcontractors
