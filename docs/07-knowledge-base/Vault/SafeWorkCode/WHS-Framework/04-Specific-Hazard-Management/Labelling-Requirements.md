# Labelling of Workplace Hazardous Chemicals

## Purpose of Labels

Labels provide immediate visual identification of:
- Chemical hazards (using pictograms)
- Severity of hazards (signal words)
- Basic safety precautions
- Supplier information

> [!important] Labels Save Lives
> Labels are the first line of communication about chemical hazards. Never use unlabelled chemicals.

## GHS Labelling System

Australia has adopted the **Globally Harmonized System (GHS)** for chemical classification and labelling.

**Benefits:**
- Consistent worldwide
- Standardized pictograms
- Clear hazard communication
- Easier to understand

## Who Must Label?

**Manufacturers and importers** must label hazardous chemicals before first supply.

**Suppliers** must ensure labels maintained during supply.

**PCBUs** must ensure labels remain legible on chemicals at workplace.

## GHS Label Elements

### 1. Product Identifier

**Chemical name** that allows the chemical to be identified.

**Must match:**
- Name on Safety Data Sheet
- Name in chemical register

**Example:** "Acetone" or "2-Propanone"

### 2. Signal Word

Indicates severity of hazard:

**DANGER** - More severe hazards

**WARNING** - Less severe hazards

Only one signal word used (DANGER takes precedence if multiple hazards).

### 3. Hazard Pictograms

**Standardized symbols in red diamond borders:**

**Health Hazards:**
- ‚ò†Ô∏è **Skull and Crossbones** - Acute toxicity (fatal/toxic)
- ‚ö†Ô∏è **Exclamation Mark** - Irritant, skin sensitizer, acute toxicity (harmful)
- ‚öïÔ∏è **Health Hazard** - Respiratory sensitizer, carcinogen, reproductive toxicity, specific organ toxicity, aspiration hazard
- ‚úï **Corrosion** - Skin corrosion, serious eye damage

**Physical Hazards:**
- üî• **Flame** - Flammable (gases, liquids, solids, aerosols)
- üí• **Exploding Bomb** - Explosives, self-reactive, organic peroxides
- ‚≠ï **Flame Over Circle** - Oxidizing (gases, liquids, solids)
- üß™ **Gas Cylinder** - Gases under pressure
- ‚ö†Ô∏è **Corrosion** - Corrosive to metals

**Environmental Hazards:**
- üêü **Environment** - Aquatic toxicity

### 4. Hazard Statements

**Standardized phrases describing hazards:**

**Physical hazards:**
- H220: Extremely flammable gas
- H225: Highly flammable liquid and vapor
- H228: Flammable solid

**Health hazards:**
- H301: Toxic if swallowed
- H315: Causes skin irritation
- H317: May cause allergic skin reaction
- H318: Causes serious eye damage
- H334: May cause allergy or asthma symptoms if inhaled
- H350: May cause cancer
- H373: May cause damage to organs through prolonged or repeated exposure

**Environmental hazards:**
- H400: Very toxic to aquatic life
- H410: Very toxic to aquatic life with long lasting effects

### 5. Precautionary Statements

**Standardized advice on:**

**Prevention:**
- P210: Keep away from heat, hot surfaces, sparks, open flames. No smoking.
- P261: Avoid breathing dust/fume/gas/mist/vapors/spray
- P280: Wear protective gloves/protective clothing/eye protection/face protection

**Response:**
- P301+P310: IF SWALLOWED: Immediately call POISON CENTER/doctor
- P302+P352: IF ON SKIN: Wash with plenty of water
- P304+P340: IF INHALED: Remove person to fresh air and keep comfortable for breathing
- P305+P351+P338: IF IN EYES: Rinse cautiously with water for several minutes. Remove contact lenses if present and easy to do. Continue rinsing.

**Storage:**
- P403: Store in well-ventilated place
- P405: Store locked up

**Disposal:**
- P501: Dispose of contents/container in accordance with regulations

### 6. Supplier Identification

**Must include:**
- Name of manufacturer/importer/supplier
- Street address (Australian address)
- Telephone number

## Decanted/Transferred Chemicals

**When chemical transferred from original container:**

**MUST label new container with:**
- Product identifier (chemical name)
- Appropriate pictograms
- Signal word
- Hazard statements
- Supplier details (or reference to original container/SDS)

**Exception:**
If chemical used immediately and container not left unattended, temporary label acceptable (minimum: chemical name, hazard pictogram).

> [!warning] Never Use Unlabelled Containers
> If container not labelled or label damaged/illegible, do not use chemical until properly labelled. Could be wrong chemical or unknown hazard.

## Small Containers

**For containers too small for full label:**

**Minimum requirements:**
- Product identifier
- Pictograms
- Signal word
- Reference to SDS (e.g., "See SDS for full information")

## Label Maintenance

**PCBUs must ensure:**
- Labels remain legible
- Labels not removed or defaced
- Labels replaced if damaged
- Decanted chemicals properly labelled

**Good practice:**
- Regular inspection of containers
- Replace damaged labels immediately
- Laminate labels exposed to weather/chemicals
- Use waterproof markers for temporary labels

## Workplace Labels vs Supplier Labels

**Supplier Label:**
- GHS format (full 6 elements)
- On original containers
- Prepared by manufacturer/importer

**Workplace Label:**
- For decanted/transferred chemicals
- May be simplified (if used immediately)
- Prepared by PCBU/workers
- Must still convey essential hazard information

## Prohibited Labelling

**Must NOT:**
- Use misleading labels
- Label in way that contradicts or detracts from GHS requirements
- Suggest chemical safe when it's hazardous

## Training Workers

**Workers must be trained to:**
- Understand GHS label elements
- Recognize pictograms
- Interpret hazard and precautionary statements
- Know what to do if label damaged/missing
- Understand importance of labelling decanted chemicals

## Practical Construction Examples

### Example 1: Two-Pack Epoxy

**Supplier Label on Original Container:**

```
DANGER

Product: Epoxy Resin Component A

Pictograms: [Health Hazard] [Exclamation Mark]

Hazard Statements:
H317: May cause allergic skin reaction
H319: Causes serious eye irritation

Precautionary Statements:
P280: Wear protective gloves/eye protection
P302+P352: IF ON SKIN: Wash with plenty of water
P305+P351+P338: IF IN EYES: Rinse cautiously with water for several minutes

Supplier: XYZ Coatings Pty Ltd
Address: 123 Industry Rd, Sydney NSW 2000
Phone: (02) 1234 5678
```

**Workplace Action:**
- Keep original containers labelled
- If mixing into smaller container for immediate use, minimum label: "Epoxy Resin - See SDS"
- If storing mixed epoxy, full label required

### Example 2: Solvent Transferred to Spray Bottle

**Original Container:** Acetone (flammable liquid)

**Workplace Label on Spray Bottle:**

```
WARNING

ACETONE

[Flame Pictogram] [Exclamation Mark]

H225: Highly flammable liquid and vapor
H319: Causes serious eye irritation

Keep away from heat/sparks/open flames
Wear eye protection
See SDS in site office

Date decanted: 15/03/2025
```

### Example 3: Concrete Cleaning Acid

**Original Container:** Hydrochloric acid solution

**Construction Site Issue:** 
Label damaged by weather, illegible.

**Action:**
1. Do not use (cannot confirm chemical or concentration)
2. Check SDS for product identifier
3. Create new label matching SDS information
4. Apply to container
5. OR transfer to new, properly labelled container
6. OR dispose and purchase new

## Common Labelling Mistakes

**‚ùå Using food/drink containers for chemicals**
Never use drink bottles, food containers for chemicals (risk of accidental ingestion).

**‚ùå "Mystery containers"**
Unlabelled containers with unknown contents (dispose safely or have tested/identified).

**‚ùå Handwritten labels without hazard info**
"Cleaner" written on bottle - what are the hazards? Not sufficient.

**‚úì Proper workplace label:**
Product name + pictograms + key hazard statements minimum.

**‚ùå Removing labels**
Scraping off damaged label and not replacing it.

**‚úì Replace immediately:**
If label damaged, replace before chemical used again.

**‚ùå Decanting without labelling**
Pouring chemical into unmarked container "for quick use."

**‚úì Label immediately:**
Even temporary containers must be labelled.

## Integration with SDS

**Labels and SDS work together:**

**Label:**
- Quick visual reference
- On container
- Key hazards only

**SDS:**
- Detailed information
- All 16 sections
- Used for risk assessment, training, emergencies

**Cross-reference:**
- Label directs to SDS
- SDS Section 2 matches label hazard information
- Both use same product identifier

See [[Safety-Data-Sheets|Safety Data Sheets]].

## Regulatory Compliance

**Inspectors check:**
- All hazardous chemicals properly labelled
- Labels legible and complete
- Decanted chemicals labelled
- Workers understand labels

**Non-compliance:**
- Improvement notices
- Prohibition notices (for immediate risk)
- Penalties

## Summary

Proper labelling ensures:
- Immediate hazard recognition
- Correct chemical identification
- Appropriate precautions taken
- Emergency responders have information
- Compliance with WHS regulations

**Key principles:**
- All hazardous chemicals must be labelled
- Use GHS format
- Keep labels legible
- Label decanted chemicals
