# Managing Risks of Plant

## What is Plant?

Plant includes machinery, equipment, appliances, containers, implements and tools, and any component or fitting.

**Construction Plant Examples:**
- **Mobile plant**: Excavators, loaders, forklifts, trucks, cranes, elevated work platforms (EWP)
- **Fixed plant**: Concrete pumps, compressors, generators, scaffolding
- **Power tools**: Saws, grinders, drills, nail guns, welding equipment
- **Pressure equipment**: Air compressors, pressure vessels
- **Lifting equipment**: Cranes, hoists, lifting beams, slings

## Common Plant Hazards

**Mechanical hazards:**
- Crush points, shear points, entanglement
- Ejected parts or materials
- Moving parts (blades, gears, belts, chains)

**Non-mechanical hazards:**
- Electricity
- Noise and vibration
- Heat, fire, explosion
- Hazardous substances (fumes, dust, hydraulic fluids)

**Operational hazards:**
- Rollover or tip-over
- Collision with workers, structures, other plant
- Falls from height (working on/near plant)
- Loads falling from height

## Who Has Duties?

### PCBUs

- Manage plant risks through risk management process
- Ensure plant safe for intended use
- Maintain plant in safe condition
- Provide information, training, supervision
- Ensure operators licensed/competent
- Register certain high-risk plant

### Designers, Manufacturers, Suppliers, Installers

Must:
- Ensure plant designed, manufactured, supplied, installed without risks
- Provide safety information
- Test and commission before supply

## High-Risk Work Licences

**WHS Regulation requires licences for:**
- **Cranes**: Bridge/gantry, derrick, portal boom, tower, vehicle loading
- **Hoists**: Materials hoists, personnel/materials hoists
- **Forklifts**: All classes
- **Elevating work platforms (EWP)**: Boom-type (vertical >11m)
- **Rigging**: Basic, intermediate, advanced
- **Dogging**: Directing crane operations, slinging loads
- **Scaffolding**: Basic, intermediate, advanced
- **Pressure equipment**: Boilers, turbines (in some jurisdictions)

> [!important] Licence Verification
> Always verify operator licences before allowing operation. Licences available at www.industrialrelations.nsw.gov.au/osg/verify-a-licence.html

## Risk Management for Plant

### 1. Identify Hazards

**Throughout Plant Lifecycle:**
- **Design**: Inherent hazards in design
- **Purchase**: Suitability for intended use
- **Installation**: Commissioning, structural support
- **Operation**: Normal use hazards
- **Maintenance**: Access, isolation, stored energy
- **Decommissioning**: Safe dismantling and disposal

### 2. Assess Risks

Consider:
- Potential injuries (severity and likelihood)
- Who is at risk (operators, other workers, public)
- When risks arise (operation, maintenance, emergencies)
- Existing control measures

### 3. Control Risks: Hierarchy of Control

**Level 1: Elimination**

- Eliminate need for plant
- Example: Pre-cast panels eliminate on-site formwork systems

**Level 2: Substitution/Engineering**

**Purchase Safe Plant:**
- Select plant with built-in safety features
- Example: Excavator with ROPS (rollover protective structure), proximity detection systems

**Guarding:**
- Fixed guards (permanent barriers over dangerous parts)
- Interlocked guards (machine stops when guard opened)
- Adjustable guards (for different operations)

**Example:** Circular saw with retractable blade guard.

**Operational Controls:**
- Two-hand controls (both hands required, keeps hands away from danger zone)
- Hold-to-run controls (requires continuous activation)
- Proximity sensors (detects workers, stops machine)
- Speed limiters, load limiters

**Emergency Stops:**
- Readily accessible
- Clearly identified (red mushroom button)
- Stops machine immediately

**Isolation:**
- Lockout/tagout for maintenance
- Isolation of electrical, hydraulic, pneumatic, mechanical energy
- Dissipation of stored energy (springs, pressure, suspended loads)

**Level 3: Administrative/PPE**

- Safe work procedures
- Training and competency assessment
- Permits for high-risk plant operations
- Exclusion zones around operating plant
- Pre-start inspections
- PPE (hearing protection, hi-vis, hard hats, safety boots)

### 4. Maintain and Review

- Regular inspections (daily pre-start, periodic detailed)
- Preventive maintenance schedules
- Competent person conducts maintenance
- Record keeping
- Review after incidents or near-misses

## Mobile Plant Safety

### Separation of Vehicles and Pedestrians

**Principle:** Keep people and moving vehicles apart.

**Controls:**
- Dedicated pedestrian walkways (physically separated)
- Exclusion zones (barricades, signage)
- Traffic management plan
- Designated crossing points
- Spotters for reversing/confined areas

**Example:** Fenced walkways on construction site separate workers from vehicle routes.

### Proximity Detection Systems

- Sensors detect workers near plant
- Alerts operator (visual/audible warning)
- May automatically stop or slow plant
- Useful for excavators, trucks with blind spots

### Visibility

- Reversing cameras and monitors
- Mirrors and visibility aids
- High-visibility clothing for workers
- Flashing beacons on plant
- Reversing alarms

> [!warning] Reversing Vehicles
> Reversing causes many injuries/fatalities. Eliminate reversing where possible, use spotters where unavoidable.

### Rollover and Tip-Over Protection

- ROPS (rollover protective structures)
- Seatbelts (must be worn in ROPS-equipped plant)
- Operating within load ratings and stability limits
- Level, stable ground conditions
- Avoid slopes, edges, underground voids

## Lifting Operations

### Before Lifting

- Plan the lift (load weight, lift path, hazards, exclusion zone)
- Select appropriate equipment (crane capacity, rigging)
- Inspect lifting equipment (cranes, slings, shackles)
- Brief all involved (crane operator, dogger, rigger, workers)
- Establish exclusion zone (no workers under suspended loads)

### During Lifting

- Competent dogger directs crane operator
- Clear communication (hand signals, radio)
- Lift smoothly (no jerking or swinging)
- No workers under suspended load
- Secure load against wind, movement

### Rigging and Slinging

- Calculate load weight
- Select correct slings (capacity, condition)
- Inspect slings before use (cuts, wear, damage)
- Use correct hitches and fittings
- Ensure load balanced and secure

## Elevated Work Platforms (EWP)

**Types:**
- Scissor lifts (vertical)
- Boom lifts (articulated/telescopic)
- Mobile and stationary

**Safety Requirements:**
- Licensed operators (boom-type >11m vertical)
- Pre-start inspection
- Level, stable ground (use outriggers if fitted)
- Guardrails intact on platform
- Harnesses required for boom-type (anchor to platform)
- Avoid overhead hazards (powerlines, structures)
- Do not exceed platform load rating
- Lower platform when traveling

> [!warning] Powerlines
> Maintain safe distances from powerlines. De-energize lines or use insulated/non-conductive equipment where work near powerlines unavoidable.

## Scaffolding

**Licensing:**
- **Basic scaffold licence**: Scaffolds up to 4 meters
- **Intermediate scaffold licence**: All scaffolds
- **Advanced scaffold licence**: Design and inspection of scaffolds

**Safety Requirements:**
- Designed for loads (live load, wind load, materials storage)
- Erected by licensed scaffolder
- Inspected before use and regularly
- Tagged (green tag = safe to use, red tag = unsafe)
- Edge protection (toe boards, mid-rails, handrails)
- Safe access (ladders, stairs)
- Stable foundation (base plates, mud sills)
- Tied to structure (prevent movement/collapse)

See [[Construction-Work|Construction Work]] for detailed scaffolding guidance.

## Plant Registration

**Certain high-risk plant must be registered:**
- Cranes (various types)
- Hoists
- Pressure vessels and boilers
- Gas cylinders

**Purpose:** Ensures design verified, item inspected, safe to operate.

## Inspections and Maintenance

### Pre-Start Inspections (Daily)

Operator checks:
- Damage, leaks, loose parts
- Safety devices functioning (guards, emergency stops, alarms)
- Fluid levels, tire pressures
- Lights, indicators, controls

**Record findings**, report defects, do not use defective plant.

### Periodic Inspections

Competent person conducts detailed inspections at intervals based on:
- Manufacturer recommendations
- Regulatory requirements (e.g., cranes, hoists)
- Risk assessment

### Maintenance

- Follow manufacturer maintenance schedules
- Use qualified technicians
- Keep records (maintenance log)
- Ensure isolated before maintenance
- Test after repairs before returning to service
