# Specific Hazard Management Overview

## Introduction

This section provides detailed guidance on managing specific hazards common in construction work. While the general [[_Risk-Management-Overview|risk management process]] applies to all hazards, certain hazards require specific controls and have dedicated regulations.

## Construction-Specific Hazards

### [[Construction-Work|Construction Work]]
Overview of construction-specific WHS requirements including:
- High-risk construction work
- Safe Work Method Statements (SWMS)
- Principal contractor duties
- Construction induction training

### [[Managing-Risk-of-Falls|Falls from Heights]]
Falls are the leading cause of workplace fatalities in construction:
- Work at heights > 2 metres
- Edge protection requirements
- Scaffolding, ladders, and elevated work platforms
- Fall arrest and travel restraint systems

### [[Excavation-Work|Excavation Work]]
Excavations present risks of collapse, falls, and service strikes:
- Excavations > 1.5 metres requiring controls
- Shoring, battering, and benching
- Locating underground services
- Excavation inspections and barricading

### [[Confined-Spaces|Confined Spaces]]
Spaces with limited entry/exit and unfavorable atmosphere:
- Confined space identification
- Atmospheric testing and monitoring
- Entry permits and procedures
- Emergency rescue arrangements

### [[Demolition-Work|Demolition Work]]
Systematic dismantling of structures:
- Demolition planning and sequencing
- Structural stability during demolition
- Hazardous materials (asbestos, lead paint)
- Dust, noise, and debris control

## Chemical and Substance Hazards

### [[Hazardous-Chemicals-Overview|Hazardous Chemicals]]
Comprehensive management of chemicals:
- Hazard identification and classification
- Safety Data Sheets (SDS) requirements
- Labelling requirements
- Control measures and exposure standards

### [[Asbestos-Overview|Asbestos Management]]
Managing and controlling asbestos:
- Asbestos identification and registers
- Friable vs non-friable asbestos
- Removal requirements and licensing
- Disposal procedures

### [[Managing-Risks-of-Respirable-Crystalline-Silica|Respirable Crystalline Silica]]
Silica dust from cutting, grinding, and drilling:
- Health effects (silicosis, lung cancer)
- On-tool dust suppression and extraction
- Health monitoring requirements
- Control measures for high-risk processes

## Plant and Equipment Hazards

### [[Managing-Risks-of-Plant|Plant and Equipment]]
Safe use of machinery and equipment:
- Plant registration and inspection
- Guarding requirements
- Maintenance and defect reporting
- Operator competency and licensing

### [[Managing-Electrical-Risks|Electrical Risks]]
Electrical hazards in construction:
- Overhead and underground power lines
- Temporary electrical installations
- Residual Current Devices (RCDs)
- Electrical work licensing requirements

## Physical Hazards

### [[Hazardous-Manual-Tasks|Manual Handling and Musculoskeletal Disorders]]
Preventing injuries from manual tasks:
- Identifying hazardous manual tasks
- Assessing MSD risks
- Control measures (mechanical aids, redesign)
- Training and technique

### [[Managing-Noise-and-Preventing-Hearing-Loss|Noise and Hearing Protection]]
Preventing noise-induced hearing loss:
- Noise exposure standards
- Noise assessments and monitoring
- Engineering controls to reduce noise
- Hearing protection requirements

## Work Environment Hazards

### [[Work-Environment-and-Facilities|Work Environment and Facilities]]
Providing adequate workplace amenities:
- Toilets and washing facilities
- Drinking water
- Meal facilities and rest areas
- First aid facilities
- Lighting and ventilation

## Applying the Risk Management Process

For each specific hazard:
1. **Identify** the hazard using guidance in the relevant code
2. **Assess** the risk considering specific factors for that hazard type
3. **Control** using the hierarchy, following specific control requirements
4. **Review** effectiveness using monitoring and consultation
