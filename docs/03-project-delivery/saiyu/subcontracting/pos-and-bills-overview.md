## Introduction

This document provides an overview of the relationship between Purchase Orders (POs), Bills, and Invoices in our project management system.

## Key Concepts

### Purchase Orders (POs)
- **Purpose:** Define the scope of spending for a specific job and subcontractor
- **Function:** Act as a commitment to purchase goods or services
- **Timing:** Created before work begins or goods are delivered

### Bills
- **Purpose:** Track actual expenses incurred
- **Function:** Link to existing POs to record what has been spent
- **Timing:** Created when invoices are received

### Invoices
- **Purpose:** Requests for payment from suppliers/subcontractors
- **Function:** Once approved, they initiate the payment process
- **Timing:** Received from external parties

## Relationship Between POs, Bills, and Invoices

2. **Work/Delivery:** Subcontractor performs work or delivers goods
3. **Invoice Receipt:** Subcontractor sends invoice for payment
4. **Bill Creation:** Invoice is processed and linked to the appropriate PO
5. **Approval:** Bill is reviewed and approved for payment
6. **Payment:** Approved bill triggers payment to subcontractor
