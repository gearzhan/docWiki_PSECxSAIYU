## Filing System and Email Management Guideline

### Labels Over Folders

Use **labels** instead of folders for better organization and flexibility. Labels allow emails to be categorized in multiple ways simultaneously.

### Shared Labels

The following labels are used across all team members:

- **Contracts**
- **Invoices**
- **Quotations**
- **Verified**
- **Pending**

### Project Label Strategy

For project-specific emails, use the format:
```
Project-[JobCode]
```

**Examples:**
- `Project-H1`
- `Project-K2`
- `Project-O2`

### Search Utilization

Leverage Gmail's powerful search functionality:
- Use keywords, sender names, date ranges
- Combine search terms with labels for precise filtering
- Save frequently used searches as filters
