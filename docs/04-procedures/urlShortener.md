## Usage Guidelines

### Core Functions

The URL shortener service provides three essential functions:

1. **URL Shortening**: Converts long URLs into manageable short links
2. **Tracking History**: Maintains a complete history of all created shortened URLs
3. **Read Tracking**: Monitors whether links have been accessed by recipients, providing valuable engagement insights

### Naming Convention

Use the following standardized naming format for shortened URLs:

**Format**: `[Project]-[Date of Issue]_[Description]`

**Examples**:
- `S1-2025.08.20_Arch Drawing for Tender`
- `K7-2025.08.20_Structural Drawing for Tender`
- `GE1-2025.07.30_DWG of Arch GA for CC Coordination`
- `GE1-DA Condition`

?> Question: Why DA condition has no date in the name?

### Best Practices
- Follow the standardized naming convention for consistency
- Include relevant dates in YYYY.MM.DD format
- Use descriptive but concise descriptions
- Monitor read tracking to confirm document delivery
- Keep a record of important shortened URLs in project files

### Security Considerations
- Do not shorten URLs containing sensitive information
- Verify the destination URL before creating shortcuts
- Use expiration dates for time-sensitive content
- Monitor usage through the tracking history feature
