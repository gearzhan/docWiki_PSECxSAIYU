## 1. Introduction

This document outlines the end-to-end procedure for managing invoices, from initial receipt to final payment, ensuring all financial transactions are accurately recorded and compliant with company policies. This workflow integrates the use of Buildertrend for creating and managing Purchase Orders (POs) and Bills.

## 2. Stage 1: Receiving and Classifying Invoices

### 2.1. Receiving Invoices

#### From Gmail Inbox
- **Responsible:** Accounts Assistant
- **Action:**
  - Daily, apply the label `Invoices-to-SAIYU` to all incoming invoices.
  - Do not **delete** original emails.

#### From Other Sources (e.g., message, physical mail)
- **Responsible:** All Staff
- **Action:**
	- **Digital invoices**: Forward to `ca@saiyu.com.au` and `cc: accountant@saiyu.com.au`.
	- **Physical invoices**: Scan and email to `ca@saiyu.com.au` and `cc: accountant@saiyu.com.au`.

### 2.2. Classifying Invoices

Before processing, identify the nature of the invoice.

- **Accounts-Related Invoices:** Monthly or fortnightly accounts (e.g., labor hire).
- **Main Sub-Contractors’ Invoices:** Lump sum, unit price (rate), or variation work.
- **One-Off Trades/Subcontractors:** Specialized services not covered under main contracts.
- **Card Payments:** Fees, council charges, one-off purchases.
- **Cash Payments:** Consult with the Account Manager (**Sunny**) for guidance.

> **Note:** If a company is not on the [Accounts & Labour Company List](11-assets/saiyu_AccountsList.md), classify it as a Main Sub-Contractor or One-Off Trade. For new subcontractors, consult with the Director (**Gear**).

## 3. Stage 2: Invoice Review and Verification

- **Responsible:** CA (Contract Admin)
- **Action:** Review each invoice using the checklist below.

**Invoice Review Checklist**

- [ ] **Duplicate Check:** Ensure the invoice has not been processed before.
- [ ] **Completeness:** Supplier name, ABN, job site, amount, GST, bank details.
- [ ] **Accuracy:**
  - [ ] **ABN Match:** Validate via [ABN Lookup](https://abr.business.gov.au/).
  - [ ] **GST:** Check that the GST is correctly calculated and stated.
- [ ] **Abnormalities:** Report unusual charges, mismatched amounts, or discrepancies to management via email and label the original email as `Pending`.
- [ ] **Filing:** Proceed to Stage 4.

## 4. Stage 3: Buildertrend Workflow

### 4.1. Purchase Orders (POs)

- **Policy:** Every subcontractor’s contractual work must have a dedicated **Purchase Order (PO)** in Buildertrend.
- **Action:** If no PO exists, refer to the procedure on **Creating a Purchase Order (PO) on Buildertrend**.

### 4.2. Creating a Bill

- **Procedure:** All invoices must be uploaded against their corresponding PO by creating a **Bill**.
- **Action:**
  - Within the relevant PO, select **"Generate Bill from PO."**
  - Fill in the bill details, ensuring the **Title** and **Attachment** fields are correct.
    - **Title:** Should reflect the invoice specifics.
    - **Attachment:** Attach the invoice document.

## 5. Stage 4: Scenario-Based Processing and Approvals

### 5.1. Scenario-Based Processing

- **Lump Sum Sub-Contracts:** Follow contract payment terms and conduct a site inspection or get foreman confirmation.
- **Unit Price Sub-Contracts:** Require a foreman-signed docket.
- **Invoices Related to Accounts:** Reconcile with account entries and budget.
- **Invoices Already Paid (Card Payment):** Verify payment, match to the statement, and update records.
- **Reimbursement Claims:** Check for completeness and attached receipts.

### 5.2. Approvals

- **Responsible:** PM/Director
- **Process:**
	- Digitally sign-off in Buildertrend by marking as “Ready for Payment”.
	- **Exceptions**: Invoices related to accounts and pre-paid invoices are auto-approved after verification.

### 5.3. Supplier Monthly Statements

- When a supplier statement is received:
    - Match each amount to the corresponding entry in Buildertrend.
