<p style="text-align:right">Date: 23.08.2025 | Revision: 2025.08.a</p>

## 1. Introduction

This document outlines the end-to-end procedure for managing invoices, from initial receipt to final payment, ensuring all financial transactions are accurately recorded and compliant with company policies. This workflow integrates the use of Buildertrend for creating and managing Purchase Orders (POs) and Bills.

## 2. Stage 1: Receiving and Classifying Invoices

### 2.1. Receiving Invoices

All invoices must be centralized in the accounting inbox for processing.

-   **Centralizing Invoices (All Staff):**
    -   **For Digital Invoices:** Apply the shared Gmail label `Invoices-to-SAIYU` or `Invoices-to-PSEC`. This automatically notifies the accounting team. **Do not forward the email.**
    -   **For Physical Invoices:** Scan the document, and email to `(SAIYU) accountant@saiyu.com.au` or `(PSEC) sywang@psecprojects.com.au`
    -   Ensure the Project Manager is included on all invoice-related emails.
    -   Do not delete the original emails.

-   **Review (Accounts Assistant):**
    -   The Accounts Assistant is responsible for monitoring the `Invoices-to-SAIYU` and `Invoices-to-PSEC` labels and processing the invoices found there.

### 2.2. PSEC-Classifying Invoices

For PSEC, invoices often relate to project disbursements and require careful handling:

-   **Nature of Invoices:** Most are reimbursement invoices for costs incurred on behalf of the client (e.g., consultant fees).
-   **Process:** Depending on the project agreement, PSEC may pay these invoices and seek reimbursement, or forward them to the client for direct payment.
-   **Verification:** **Always** confirm the correct procedure with `Sunny` before filing, as the process is project-specific.

### 2.3. SAIYU-Classifying Invoices

For SAIYU, Before processing, identify the nature of the invoice.

- **Accounts-Related Invoices:** Monthly or fortnightly accounts (e.g., labor hire).
- **Sub-Contractors’ Invoices:** Lump sum, unit price (rate), or variation work.
- **One-Off Trades/Subcontractors:** Specialized services not covered under main contracts.
- **Card Payments:** Fees, council charges, one-off purchases.
- **Cash Payments:** Consult with the Account Manager (**Sunny**) for guidance.

> **Note:** If a company is not on the [Accounts & Labour Company List](11-assets/saiyu_AccountsList.md), classify it as a Sub-Contractor or One-Off Trade. For new subcontractors, consult with the Director (**Gear**).

## 3. Stage 2: Invoice Review and Verification

- **Responsible:** CA (Contract Admin), Account Manager
- **Action:** Review each invoice using the checklist below.

**Invoice Review Checklist**

- [ ] **Duplicate Check:** Ensure the invoice has not been processed before.
- [ ] **Completeness:** Supplier name, ABN, job site, amount, GST, bank details.
- [ ] **Accuracy:**
  - [ ] **ABN Match:** Validate via [ABN Lookup](https://abr.business.gov.au/).
  - [ ] **GST:** Check that the GST is correctly calculated and stated.
- [ ] **Abnormalities:** Report unusual charges, mismatched amounts, or discrepancies to management via email and label the original email as `Pending`.
- [ ] **Filing:** Proceed to Stage 4.

## 4. Stage 3: Buildertrend Workflow

### 4.1. Purchase Orders (POs)

- **Policy:** Every subcontractor’s contractual work must have a dedicated **Purchase Order (PO)** in Buildertrend.
- **Action:** If no PO exists, refer to the procedure on **Creating a Purchase Order (PO) on Buildertrend**.

### 4.2. Creating a Bill

- **Procedure:** All invoices must be uploaded against their corresponding PO by creating a **Bill**.
- **Action:**
  - Within the relevant PO, select **"Generate Bill from PO."**
  - Fill in the bill details, ensuring the **Title** and **Attachment** fields are correct.
    - **Title:** Should reflect the invoice specifics.
    - **Attachment:** Attach the invoice document.

## 5. Stage 4: Scenario-Based Processing and Approvals (SAIYU)

### 5.1. Scenario-Based Processing

- **Lump Sum Sub-Contracts:** Follow contract payment terms and conduct a site inspection or get foreman confirmation.
- **Unit Price Sub-Contracts:** Require a foreman-signed docket.
- **Invoices Related to Accounts:** Reconcile with account entries and budget.
- **Invoices Already Paid (Card Payment):** Verify payment, match to the statement, and update records.
- **Reimbursement Claims:** Check for completeness and attached receipts.

### 5.2. Approvals

- **Responsible:** PM/Director
- **Process:**
	- Digitally sign-off in Buildertrend by marking as “Ready for Payment”.
	- **Exceptions**: Invoices related to accounts and pre-paid invoices are auto-approved after verification.

### 5.3. Supplier Monthly Statements

- When a supplier statement is received:
    - Match each amount to the corresponding entry in Buildertrend.
    - If amounts match, mark the invoice as **"Ready for Payment"**.
    - If discrepancies are found, investigate and resolve before proceeding.
