## Scope

This procedure outlines the steps for uploading invoices into Buildertrend, ensuring that all financial transactions are accurately recorded and linked. By following these steps, you maintain financial control and facilitate efficient payment processes.

---

## Stage 1: Identify the Contractor and Nature of the Invoice

Before uploading an invoice, determine the contractor it relates to and classify the type of invoice. The invoice can fall into one of the following categories:

### 1.1 Accounts-Related Invoices

- **Monthly Accounts**
- **Fortnightly Accounts** (e.g., labor hire companies)

> **Note:**
> * If the company is **not listed** on the [Accounts & Labour Company List](/Sub-Contract/database), it should be classified under **Main Sub-Contractors** or **One-Off Trades/Subcontractors**.
> * For **new subcontractors**, consult with the Director (**Gear**) before proceeding.

### 1.2 Main Sub-Contractors’ Invoices

- **Lump Sum Contract**
- **Unit Price (Rate) Contract**
- **Variation Work** to the contract

### 1.3 One-Off Trades/Subcontractors

- Specialized services or tasks not covered under main contracts.

### 1.4 Card Payments

- Fees, Council, Sydney Water, Officeworks etc.
- One-off Purchases.
- Note: ==Sometimes may relate to One-Off Trades/Subcontractors.==

### 1.5 Cash Payments

- **Action Required:** Consult with the Account Manager (**Sunny**) for guidance.

## Stage 2: Handling Contractors’ Invoices

### 2.1 Purchase Orders (POs)

- **Policy:**
  - Each subcontractor’s contractual work must have an **individual Purchase Order (PO)** created in **Buildertrend**.
  - **If no PO exists** for the project or job:
    - Refer to the procedure on **Creating a Purchase Order (PO) on Buildertrend**.

### 2.2 Uploading Invoices

- **Procedure:**
  - All invoices **must be uploaded** against their **pre-existing PO** using **Bills** in the system.
  - **Bills** will be created to **match the invoices** and must be **linked** to the appropriate **POs**.

---

## Summary

By following these steps, you ensure that all invoices are accurately recorded and linked within **Buildertrend**, maintaining financial control and facilitating efficient payment processes.

---

## Additional Notes

- **Financial Control:** Linking invoices to the correct POs and Bills ensures that expenditures do not exceed approved amounts.
- **Consultation:** Always consult with the relevant managers (Director **Gear** or Account Manager **Sunny**) when in doubt.
- **Documentation:** Keep records of all invoices, POs, and Bills for auditing and accountability purposes.
