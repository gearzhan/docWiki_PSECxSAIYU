## Overview

This document outlines how to use **Fieldwire's Tasks** feature for effective project management for **PSEC**. The system is structured to support compliance tracking, meeting follow-ups, and documentation of open issues using tags, filters, and categories. Emphasis is placed on using **tags** to organize tasks such as **CC Checklists**, **OC Checklists**, and **Meeting** and  **Minutes**.

> Always use the standardized tags and status formats when creating or editing tasks to ensure consistent filtering and reporting.

## Task Filtering and Navigation

### Accessing All Tasks

1. **Open Fieldwire Web App** and log into the PSEC project.
2. Click on the **Tasks** tab in the left-hand navigation bar.
3. Under the Tasks section, select **All Tasks** to view the complete list.

### Filtering by Tag

1. Click the **Filter** button at the top of the task list.
2. In the **Tag** section of the filter menu:
   - Tick **`meeting`** and **`minutes`** to display all meeting-related items.
   - Tick **`cc checklist`** or **`oc checklist`** to focus on compliance conditions.
3. Any lost items (i.g. new created tasks), can be found by applying `no tag`.

> Tags are essential for organizing task visibility—always ensure tasks are properly tagged when created.

## Task Status and Priority System

### Status Naming Convention

Tasks follow the naming format based on the **PCA CC checklist**, so might **differ** from project to project.

> e.g. for Gerringong Project.
> - **Not Satisfied** – High Priority
> - **Not Submitted** – Normal Priority
> - **On Hold**
> - **Satisfied**
> - **Noted Only**

### Overdue Highlighting

- **Urgent** status has been removed for screen clarity.
- Marking a task as **Overdue** will highlight it in the far left column of the task list.

## Archiving and Auto-Hide Function

1. When a task reaches **Satisfied** and no further action is required:
   - Manually mark `meeting` / `minuts` tasks as **Archive**.
   - if it is an `OC or CC Checklist` item, leave the item as **Satisfied**
2. Archived tasks will **auto-hide** after 7–14 days.
3. To view archived tasks, enable the toggle switch in the task view settings.

> Archived tasks are hidden, not deleted—they can be re-shown anytime via toggle settings.

## Task Categorization by Consultant

- Each consultant involved in the project (e.g., PCA, certifier, structural engineer) has their own **task category**.
- Assign new tasks to the correct consultant category during creation to ensure proper accountability.
