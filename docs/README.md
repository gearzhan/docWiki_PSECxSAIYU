# PSEC x SAIYU Wiki

## Welcome to the 2025 Wiki

This wiki is a **set of rules, tools, and guidelines** created to support daily operations. Its purpose is to build a common foundation that reduces the learning curve when picking up new projects and ensures consistency across our work.

However, I believe strongly that *all rules are made to be challenged*. Treat the contents here not as rigid codes, but as **tools**—a flexible Swiss Army knife for efficiency and clarity. The efficiency we aim for is measured in the long run, through smoother collaboration and fewer preventable errors.

Think of it like carpentry:
- When rounding a corner, you need a specific rounding machine and bit.
- That tool exists for one purpose only, but it does the job with precision.

In the same way, each rule in this wiki is a **specialised tool** designed to improve a specific task. Use them as they fit the job, and allow for **common-sense relaxation** when needed to keep work flowing.

You are encouraged to:
- **Question and challenge** the rules.
- **Adapt** them when context demands.
- **Suggest new tools** when you see gaps.

This wiki is not a closed system—it’s a **living toolkit**, always open to refinement. Read it first, understand the tools, then apply them with judgment.

Enjoy, and use it well.
