# Development Flow Process

This document describes the development flowchart with stages like Development Application (DA), Construction Certificate (CC), and Occupation Certificate (OC), including authorities, standards, and legal frameworks.

## Development Stages

### Development Application (DA)
The Development Application is the first formal step in the development process, submitted to the relevant consent authority for approval of proposed development.

### Construction Certificate (CC)
A Construction Certificate certifies that the plans and specifications comply with the Building Code of Australia and relevant Australian Standards.

### Occupation Certificate (OC)
An Occupation Certificate is issued when construction is complete and the building is ready for occupation, certifying compliance with development consent and construction requirements.

## Authorities and Standards

### Relevant Authorities
- Local councils
- State planning departments
- Building certifiers
- Fire and safety authorities

### Applicable Standards
- Building Code of Australia (BCA)
- Australian Standards (AS)
- National Construction Code (NCC)
- Local Environmental Plans (LEP)

## Legal Framework

The development process operates within a comprehensive legal framework that includes:

- Environmental Planning and Assessment Act
- Building and Development Control Regulations
- Local government planning instruments
- State environmental planning policies

## Process Flow

1. **Pre-Development Planning**
   - Site analysis
   - Feasibility studies
   - Preliminary consultations

2. **Development Application Stage**
   - Preparation of DA documentation
   - Submission to consent authority
   - Public exhibition (if required)
   - Assessment and determination

3. **Construction Certificate Stage**
   - Detailed design development
   - CC application preparation
   - Technical compliance verification
   - Certificate issuance

4. **Construction Phase**
   - Commencement of works
   - Inspections and compliance monitoring
   - Progress certifications

5. **Occupation Certificate Stage**
   - Final inspections
   - Compliance verification
   - OC application and issuance

## Key Considerations

- Compliance with all relevant codes and standards
- Coordination between various authorities
- Timing and sequencing of approvals
- Documentation requirements at each stage
- Quality assurance and compliance monitoring
