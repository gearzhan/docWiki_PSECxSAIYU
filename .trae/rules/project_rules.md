Project name: PSEC x SAIYU Wiki
- This repo is not a programming project, it is a knowledge base in Markdown (.md) files.
- The purpose is to create a unified, well-structured wiki for two companies:
  - SAIYU Construction (Building Services).
  - PSEC Project Services (Architectural Services).
Tasks:
- Maintain wiki databse in a clear hierarchy that supports both companies.
- Propose naming conventions, folder structure, and file organization (e.g., separate /assets folder for images, diagrams, and external references).
- Maintain consistency across filing systems, revision naming, and document indexing.
- Write documentation in clean, professional Markdown with clear cross-links.
- I should NOT generate code solutions unless explicitly asked. The repo is to be treated like a knowledge management project, not a software project.
- I should NOT amend index.html unless explicitly asked.
