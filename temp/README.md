# PSEC x SAIYU Knowledge Base

Welcome to the unified documentation hub for **PSEC Architecture** and **SAIYU Construction**.  
This wiki consolidates project knowledge, standards, and workflows into a single platform.

---

## 📚 Purpose
- Provide a **central reference point** for both companies.
- Maintain **consistency** across document control, revision tracking, and knowledge sharing.
- Support **efficient navigation** with Docsify-based search and sidebar hierarchy.
- Enable **future scalability** with structured file/folder organization.

## 📂 Platform

This knowledge base is built on **Docsify.js**, migrated from **Wiki.js**.

- **Navigation**: Powered by `_sidebar.md` for unified structure.  
- **Themes**: Light/Dark toggle for accessibility.  
- **Diagrams**: Integrated **Mermaid** support for flowcharts and diagrams.  
- **Search**: Full-text search with instant results.  
- **Hosting Options**: GitHub Pages, Vercel, or internal servers.  
- **Assets**: Dedicated `/assets` folder for:
  - Images
  - Diagrams
  - External references

The platform is designed for **flexibility and growth**, covering both:
- **SAIYU Construction** (existing knowledge base)  
- **PSEC Architecture** (new and expanded)

## 📝 Revision Naming Rules

All documents must follow a **structured revision naming convention** to ensure traceability and consistency:

```
[DocumentName]_Rev[Number/Letter]_[Date:YYYYMMDD]_[Initials]
```

### Example:
```
DesignBrief_RevA_20250823_JD
```

**Guidelines:**
- **DocumentName**: Use a clear, descriptive name.  
- **Rev[Number/Letter]**: Increment with each revision (e.g., RevA, RevB, Rev1).  
- **Date**: Always in `YYYYMMDD` format.  
- **Initials**: Include author/preparer initials for accountability.  

---

## 📖 How to Use
1. Navigate using the **sidebar menu**.  
2. Use **search** to quickly find documents.  
3. Follow the **revision rules** when updating or adding files.  
4. Store all media and external references in the `/assets` folder.  

---

## 🚀 Next Steps
- Continue expanding **PSEC Architecture** documentation.  
- Merge existing **SAIYU Construction** content under the unified structure.  
- Standardize templates, compliance tables, and workflows across both companies.
